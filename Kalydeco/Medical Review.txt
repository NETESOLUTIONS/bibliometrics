REVIEW SUMMARY:
Background: This is a medical Officer brief review regarding a Response to Information Request for
NDA 203,188, for VX-770. Vertex Pharmaceuticals submitted their completed NDA package on
10/18/2011, for VX-770, which is proposed to modify CFTR channel gating in subjects with CF and a
G551D mutation. During the filing and initial review process, we noted that in the NDA package, a
(b) (4)
Contracted Research Organization,
was listed as having been
contracted to assist with data management. An Information Request dated November 10, 2011 was sent
to the Sponsor, asking for them to clarify the role and responsibility of this CRO with regard to data
collection and management.
(b) (4)
This submission was a clarification from the Sponsor tha
did not function as a CRO, but
instead provided staff and services to create study documentation and provide training to staff. They
clarified that Vertex maintained all data management for the covered trials.

COMMENTS TO THE SPONSOR WITH REGARD TO DRAFT LABELING
We have the following initial comments on the labeling submitted as part of the NDA
October 18, 2011. These are based on information required in labeling as noted in 21
CFR 201.56 and the Guidance for Industry, Clinical Studies Section of Labeling for
Human Prescription Drug and Biological Product - Content and Format, January 2006.
We ask that you make the changes listed below and resubmit a revised package insert.
Indications and Usage
•

Spell out the words for “CFTR” when used in the label for the first time.

•

Insert a “Limitations of Use” subheading to note that Kalydeco has been shown
to be effective only patients with cystic fibrosis who have a G551D mutation in
the CFTR gene and that it is not effective in patients with cystic fibrosis who are
homozygous for the F508 mutation in the CFTR.

•

Insert a statement indicating that an FDA-approved test should be used to
identify the presence of the G551D mutation.

VX-770 (ivacaftor)

1 Recommendations/Risk Benefit Assessment
1.1 Recommendation on Regulatory Action
The recommended regulatory action, from a clinical perspective, is Approval of VX-770
(ivacaftor) for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients age 6 years and older who
have a G551D mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
(CFTR) gene, at a chronic dose of 150mg orally every 12 hours, taken with a fatcontaining food.

1.2 Risk Benefit Assessment
The risk-benefit profile supports the approval of VX-770, as noted above. For this
program, efficacy was demonstrated in two randomized, placebo-controlled, doubleblinded clinical trials of 48 weeks’ duration, in which treatment with VX-770 improved
lung function (as measured by absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 from
baseline to week 24) by 10 and 12% in studies in adolescents/ adults, and in children
aged 6-11 years, respectively. Secondary endpoints, including weight gain and time to
first exacerbation, were supportive of efficacy. VX-770 was well-tolerated, and
demonstrated no major safety signals in clinical trials. No deaths were reported, SAEs
were generally those associated with CF (exacerbations, pneumonia, GI issues), and
number of discontinuations was low. Common AE included headache, upper
respiratory tract infection, nasal congestion, nausea, rash, rhinitis, dizziness, arthralgia,
and bacteria in sputum, which were generally well-tolerated. Laboratory assessments
suggest the possibility that VX-770 may be associated with an increase in liver
transaminases, but the increase was only slightly over those who received placebo
treatment in the clinical trials. Transaminases are recommended to be monitored in
patients receiving VX-770. There are a number of drug-drug interactions for VX-770;
these will be addressed in labeling. Overall, there is a robust clinical benefit for VX-770,
with no major safety signals identified.

1.3 Recommendations for Postmarket Risk Evaluation and Mitigation
Strategies
Given the favorable risk-benefit determination and safety profile of VX-770, no formal
postmarket risk evaluation and mitigation strategies are warranted. The continued
evaluation of safety can be assessed with standard pharmacovigilence, as required by
regulation. However, the Applicant plans to further evaluate the safety of long-term VX-

VX-770 (ivacaftor)
770 use in the post-market setting as a voluntary measure, by initiating a long-term
observational study which will utilize data collected in existing CF patient registries.
The Applicant is also planning studies to evaluate the effects of VX-770 in pediatric
patients less than 6 years of age with a G551D mutation, as well as in patients with
other gating mutations, and those who have a mutation in CFTR with residual CFTR
function.

1.4 Recommendations for Postmarket Requirements and Commitments
There are no recommendations from the Clinical team for any post-marketing
commitments or requirements.

2 Introduction and Regulatory Background
2.1 Product Information
Information
The chemical name for VX-770 (also called ivacaftor) is N-(2, 4-Di-tert-butyl-5hydroxyphenyl)-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxymide. The proposed trade name
is Kalydeco®. VX-770 is a new molecular entity, which is an orally-bioavailable small
molecule that targets the underlying defect in a subgroup of patients with cystic fibrosis.
Its proposed mechanism of action is to act on the CFTR protein to increase the channelopen probability (gating) to increase chloride transport (see Brief Clinical Background
section below for more details). The proposed indication for VX-770 is for the
treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients age 6 years and older who have a G551D
mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The
proposed chronic dosing regimen is 150mg every 12 hours, to be taken with a fatcontaining food.
VX-770 is formulated as a waxed, light blue film-coated tablet containing 150mg of VX770 drug substance. Each tablet contains the following excipients: colloidal silicon
dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, hypromellose acetate succinate, lactose monohydrate,
magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, and sodium lauryl sulfate. The tablet
film coat contains carnauba wax, FD&C Blue #2, PEG 3350, polyvinyl alcohol, talc, and
titanium dioxide. The printing ink contains ammonium hydroxide, iron oxide black,
propylene glycol, and shellac.

VX-770 (ivacaftor)
The to-be-marketed formulation is the same as those used in Phase 2B/3 trials, except
tablets were packaged as blister dose cards for the clinical trials, but will be marketed in
high-density polyethylene 60-tablet bottles.
Brief Clinical Background
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease that affects
approximately 30,000 children and adults in the United States1, and approximately
36,000 children and adults in Europe2. Approximately one in 3,500 children in the
United States is born with CF each year, and CF affects all ethnic and racial groups,
although is most common in Caucasians. There is no cure for cystic fibrosis, and
despite progress in the treatment of the disease, the predicted median age of survival
for a person with CF is the mid-30’s1.
In 1989, researchers discovered the gene that caused CF3, which codes for the cystic
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. The CFTR protein is an
epithelial chloride ion channel, which aids in the regulation of salt and water absorption
and secretion throughout the body. Lack of properly functioning CFTR is responsible
for the clinical sequelae of CF, including malabsorption of nutrients, and the inability to
mobilize tenacious respiratory secretions, leading to recurrent infections and lung
damage. While CF affects most organ systems in the body, the majority of morbidity
and mortality from cystic fibrosis results from its effects in the lungs4. The lack of
normally functioning CFTR causes abnormal chloride secretion and water reabsorption,
leading to dehydration of the airway surface liquid and impaired mucociliary clearance.
Over time, the CF lung is exposed to a vicious cycle of infection, inflammation, and
damage, which causes progressive and irreversible airways obstruction, bronchiectasis,
and ultimately respiratory failure5, 6.
The mutations in the CFTR gene result in reductions in quantity, quality, or both, of the
CFTR proteins. These mutations have been classified into groups by their mechanism
of action. Class 2 mutations (such as F508) cause improper folding and processing of
the protein, which leads to degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum and failure of the
protein to reach the cell membrane. Class 3 mutations (such as G551D) create proteins
that reach the cell surface, but do not respond normally to activation signals7, and are
termed “gating mutations.”
Agents that increase the chloride ion transport properties of the channel in the presence
of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A activation have been termed “potentiators” in
the literature. VX-770 is one such drug; currently, there are no drugs marketed that
alter CFTR function. By increasing the chloride channel opening, these agents could
lead to more normally hydrated airway secretions, which could break the cycle of
obstruction, infection, inflammation, and damage that ultimately leads to respiratory
failure for patients with CF.

2.3 Availability of Proposed Active Ingredient in the United States
VX-770 is a new molecular entity, and is not currently marketed in the United States.

2.4 Important Safety Issues with Consideration to Related Drugs
VX-770 is a new molecular entity with no related drugs, so there are no issues to note.

2.5 Summary of Presubmission Regulatory Activity Related to Submission
Prior to submission of this NDA, VX-770 has been the subject of multiple regulatory
proceedings, (as IND 74,633), summarized below:
•

•
•

•

•

Opening IND Submission (March 13, 2006)
o Initial safety review noted that preclinical data did not support doses over
500mg
o Teleconference held with Applicant (April 12, 2006) to discuss modification
of protocol
o The modified protocol with doses <500mg was allowed to proceed
Fast Track designation granted (May 4, 2006)
Orphan drug product designation granted (December 20th, 2006) for the
treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis
End-of-Phase-1 Meeting (June 28, 2008) Key points discussed included:
o Clinical relevance of sweat chloride as a biomarker in CF has not been
demonstrated
o Controlled data for 1 year would better support durability of treatment
effect
o Safety data for 1 year was recommended
o Study 103 (small pediatric study) showing a positive trend to support
Study 102 in adolescents and adults would likely be adequate for
approval, given the small number of patients
FDA sent End-of-Phase-2 pre-meeting comments to Applicant (April 13th, 2009)
o Meeting was later cancelled
o Comments reflected that positive results from Study 102 and positive
trending efficacy data from 103, and 48-week safety data including study
104 would be adequate for filing
Clinical Pre-NDA meeting held with Applicant (June 17, 2011), discussion
included:
o The need for 48-week data at the time of NDA submission
o That the Center for Devices and Radiologic Health (CDRH) would need to
be involved with regard to potential genetic testing issues

CDRH sent a Pre-IDE Memorandum to the Applicant (July 29, 2011), with regard
to potential development of CF mutation screening test
o Since there are six 510(k)-cleared genetic mutation screening tests on the
market, as well as gene sequence testing, CDRH informed the Applicant
that it would not be necessary for them to develop their own test if they did
not wish to do so
The Applicant began submitting portions of the NDA (July 27, 2011)
NDA submission was completed (October 18, 2011)

2.6 Other Relevant Background Information
Not applicable

3 Ethics and Good Clinical Practices
3.1 Submission Quality and Integrity
The original NDA dated October 18, 2011, was submitted in electronic common
technical document (eCTD) format, well-organized, and easily navigated by this
reviewer. There were no issues with respect to submission quality and/or integrity.
The Division has requested an audit by the Office of Scientific Investigation (OSI) for
this NDA, since VX-770 is new molecular entity proposed for an indication for which
there are no FDA-approved therapies. Due to the rarity of this orphan disease, and
that only 4% of the CF population carries a G551D mutation, there were a large number
of US and international clinical trial sites, with few subjects enrolled at each site. Two
sites were recommended for audit based on relatively high enrollment, and
demonstration of outcomes that were in favor of VX-770. Preliminary report of the DSI
inspections notes that there were no deficiencies found at the clinical sites operated by
Drs. Billings and Uluer, and that both were in compliance with Good Clinical Practices
(GCP), and required no action (NAI). In addition, because VX-770 is a new molecular
entity, the Vertex company site was also inspected, to assess the Applicant’s oversight
of the clinical trials; this inspection was found to be in compliance with regulations.
Overall, the OSI inspections concluded that no regulatory violations were noted, and
based on inspectional findings, the study data collected appear generally reliable in
support of the requested indication. Please refer to Dr. Anthony Orencia’s Clinical
Inspection Summary for further details.

General Toxicology
General toxicology studies were conducted in the mouse, rat, and dog up to 3-months,
6-months, and 12-months. Target organs identified by general toxicity studies included
the liver in mice and rats (hepatocellular necrosis), and the gastrointestinal tract in dogs
(clinical signs of abnormal feces and vomiting). Supraventricular premature complex
(SVPC) was also observed in dogs in the 12-month toxicity study. Gastrointestinal
clinical signs and ECG findings were considered to be clinically monitorable, and were
not used in safety factor determinations for clinical doses.
Genetic Toxicology
VX-770 was negative in a bacterial reverse mutation assay, a Chinese hamster ovary
chromosomal aberration assay, and in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay.
Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity
A battery of reproductive and developmental toxicity studies of VX-770 were completed
in rats and rabbits. These studies evaluated the effect of VX-770 on fertility in rats,
teratogenicity in rats and rabbits, and peri- and post-natal development in rats. Results
showed that VX-770 decreased fertility indices in male and female rats at doses of 200
mg/kg/day, but that the dose that caused any fertility effect was essentially the lethal
dose in the parent animal, giving the finding of impaired fertility at the highest dose no
clinical relevance. Results from teratogenicity studies demonstrated that the drug was
non-teratogenic in rats and rabbits. VX-770 had no effects on peri- and post-natal
development in rats. The NOAEL of VX-770 for reproductive toxicity was 100 and 100
mg/kg/day in rat and rabbits, respectively. Please refer to the full non-clinical
Reproductive Toxicology Review of Dr. Luqi Pei for more detailed information.
Carcinogenicity
2-year mouse and 2-year rat carcinogenicity studies were carried out under GLP, and
with agreement by the FDA. The Executive Carcinogenicity Advisory Committee
(ECAC) concurred that both mouse and rat carcinogenicity studies were acceptable and
that there were no test article-related tumor findings in either study. The ECAC also
concurred that coverage for parent and metabolites was acceptable.

4.4 Clinical Pharmacology
The Clinical Pharmacology recommendation is for Approval. Refer to sections 7.2.5
and 7.5.5 of this review, and Dr Lokesh Jain’s Clinical Pharmacology Review, for
additional clinical pharmacology information.

4.4.1

Mechanism of Action

VX-770 is a potentiator of the CFTR protein. The CFTR protein is a chloride channel
present at the surface of epithelial cells in multiple organs. VX-770 appears to increase
the probability of CFTR channel opening (or gating) to enhance chloride transport.

4.4.2

Pharmacodynamics

Sweat Chloride Evaluation
In clinical trials in patients with the G551D mutation in the CFTR gene, VX-770 led to
statistically significant reductions in sweat chloride concentration. In two randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials (one in patients 12years and older, and
the other in patients 6-11 years of age), the mean change in sweat chloride from
baseline through week 24 was -48 (95% CI -51, -45) and -54 (95% CI -62, -47),
respectively. These changes persisted through 48 weeks. The clinical significance of
this finding is unknown.
ECG Evaluation (Thorough QT Study)
A thorough QT study was conducted for this program, and reviewed by the QT study
interdisciplinary review team. The study consisted of 2 parts: Part A in which 8 subjects
were enrolled to evaluate the safety and tolerability of increasing doses of VX-770 up to
450 mg every 12 hours (q12h), followed by Part B to determine if therapeutic or
supratherapeutic systemic exposure to multiple doses of VX-770 up to 450 mg q12h
prolongs the mean Fridericia-corrected QT (QTcF) interval by more than 5 milliseconds.
No significant toxicities were identified in Part A. The actual effect of multiple doses of
VX-770 150 mg and 450 mg on QTc was evaluated in Part B; a double-blind,
randomized, placebo- and active-controlled, single center, 4-period crossover study in
which 72 subjects received VX-770 150 mg q 12h, VX-770 450 mg q 12h, placebo, and
moxifloxacin 400 mg (the active comparator). The study was appropriately designed;
the supratherapeutic dose of 450 mg q 12h produced mean Cmax approximately 4 times
higher than the mean Cmax for the therapeutic dose of 150 mg q 12h. No significant
QTc prolongation effect of VX-770 at the doses tested was detected. The largest upper
bounds of the 2-sided 90% CI for the mean differences between VX-770 150 mg and
placebo, and between VX-770 450 mg and placebo were below 10 ms (the threshold for
regulatory concern). Assay sensitivity was demonstrated as the largest lower bound of
the 2-sided 90% CI for the
QTcF for the active comparator moxifloxacin was greater
than 5 ms.

VX-770 (ivacaftor)
In summary, treatment with VX-770 at the therapeutic dose (150 mg every12 hours) or
at a supratherapeutic dose (450 mg every12 hours) had no significant QTc prolongation
effect, on the QTcF and QTcB intervals.

4.4.3

Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of VX-770 is similar between healthy adult volunteers and
patients with CF.
After oral administration of a single 150 mg dose to healthy volunteers in fed state, peak
plasma concentrations (Tmax) occurred at approximately 4 hours, and the mean (+SD)
for AUC and Cmax were 8814 + 4363 ng*hr/mL and 673 + 245 ng/mL, respectively.
After every 12 hour dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of VX-770 were
reached by days 3 to 5, with accumulation ratio ranging from 2.2 to 2.9.
Absorption
The exposure of VX-770 increased approximately 2- to 4-fold when given with food
containing fat. Therefore, VX-770 should be administered with fat-containing food. The
median (range) Tmax is approximately 4.0 (3.0; 6.0) hours in the fed state.
Distribution
VX-770 is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha 1-acid
glycoprotein and albumin. VX-770 does not bind to human red blood cells.
The mean apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of VX-770 after a single dose of 275
mg of VX-770 in the fed state was similar for healthy volunteers and patients with CF.
Metabolism
VX-770 is extensively metabolized in humans. In vitro and clinical studies indicate that
VX-770 is primarily metabolized by CYP3A. M1 and M6 are the two major metabolites
of VX-770 in humans. M1 has approximately one-sixth the potency of VX-770 and is
considered pharmacologically active. M6 has less than one-fiftieth the potency of VX770 and is not considered pharmacologically active.
Section 7.5.5 Drug-Drug Interactions, of this review contains more detailed information
on metabolism and drug-drug interactions; please refer there for more details.
Elimination
Following oral administration, the majority of VX-770 (87.8%) is eliminated in the feces
after metabolic conversion. The major metabolites M1 and M6 accounted for
approximately 65% of the total dose eliminated with 22% as M1 and 43% as M6. There
was negligible urinary excretion of VX-770 as unchanged parent. The apparent terminal
half-life was approximately 12 hours following a single dose. The mean (SD) apparent

clearance (CL/F) of VX-770 was similar for healthy volunteers and patients with CF:
CL/F was 12.1 (5.0) L/hr in healthy volunteers and 12.4 (5.9) L/hr in patients with CF.

5 Sources of Clinical Data
5.1 Tables of Studies/Clinical Trials
The Applicant’s Clinical Development program for VX-770 was comprised of 22 clinical
studies, which include fifteen clinical pharmacology studies in healthy volunteers, two
studies in patients with cystic fibrosis to evaluate exploratory biomarkers, and five
Phase 2/3 studies which form the primary basis for evaluation of the clinical efficacy and
safety of VX-770 in patients with cystic fibrosis. These studies are briefly described in
the tables below.
Reviewer’s Comment:
The Applicant notes throughout their package that their program consists of 23 studies,
but only 22 are listed in Module 5.2, under development for this IND. When we queried
the Applicant, they noted that they included a single-patient IND using VX-770 drug
product in their total count, but did not include further reference to it in their NDA
submission, because the individual Clinical Investigator (and not Vertex) is responsible
for control of that data.

5.2 Review Strategy
The clinical development program for VX-770 was relatively small, as would be
expected for a program designed for a small subset of an orphan patient population.
Dose ranging exploration was limited to studies 101 and 103 Part A. The twice-daily
dosing regimen was based on results of pharmacokinetic studies that showed a terminal
half-life of 12 hours. The initial proof-of-concept data was collected in Study 101.
Although the Applicant has identified Studies 102 and 103 as pivotal for supporting the
efficacy and safety of VX-770 in a population of patients with CF and at least one copy
of the G551D mutation > 6 years of age, Study 104 is also relevant in that it
demonstrates the lack of efficacy in the CF population who are homozygous for the
F508 deletion in CFTR, and also adds additional support for the safety of VX-770 in
the CF population. Study 105 is the open-label extension for CF patients who have
completed the 48 week treatment periods in Studies 102 and 103 Part B, and provides
additional unblinded long-term safety data for the indicated population.
As studies 101, 102, 103, and 104 are each important for assessing the safety and
efficacy of VX-770 in patients with cystic fibrosis, all will be reviewed individually below.
Study 105 will be very briefly described, since it adds additional unblinded safety data to
support the program, and will be addressed further in the Summary of Safety, Section 7.
To orient the reader, the review has been organized in the following manner. The
protocols for trials 101, 102, 103, and 104 are discussed in detail in section 5.3,
“Discussion of Individual Studies/ Clinical Trials.” Dose selection based on the results
of Studies 101 and 103 Part A, and efficacy results for each trial (patient disposition,
demographics, primary and secondary outcomes) are presented in section 6, “Review
of Efficacy.” Safety results from Studies 102, 103, 104, and the open-label long-term
safety extension Study 105, including extent of exposure, deaths, serious adverse
events, and adverse events, are presented in Section 7, “Review of Safety.”

same 28 days as VX-770 study treatment. The patients were randomized on Day 1,
and assessments were collected on Days 1, 3, 9, 14, 21, and 28, with a Follow-up Visit
5-9 days after the last dose of study drug.
Screening assessments were the same for both Parts 1 and 2, and included informed
consent, history and physical, weight, vital signs, genotype confirmation, sweat chloride,
nasal potential difference (NPD) and other CF-related labs (aldosterone,
immunoreactive trypsinogen {IRT}), baseline safety clinical labs and ECGs, and
respiratory studies (pulse oximetry and spirometry).
The Part 1 treatment periods consisted of similar assessments as the screening period,
except that IRT was not collected, and nasal potential difference was performed on
Days 1 and 14. In addition, a patient symptom questionnaire and PK assessments
were collected on assessment days (Days 1, 7, and 14). The washout period between
treatments included a telephone contact, if longer than 10 days.
The Part 2 treatment period consisted of similar assessments on Days 1, 3, 14, 21, and
28, except that nasal potential difference was collected on days 1, 14, and 28, a phone
assessment was added on Day 9, and that the symptom questionnaire was replaced by
the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire revised (CFQ-R). The CFQ-R is a disease-specific
health-related quality of life measure for cystic fibrosis. It consists of generic and CFspecific scales (grouped into 3 modules and 9 domains) that measure quality of life,
health perception, and symptoms over a 2-week recall period. It is available in ageappropriate formats, including a child age 6-11 interview format, a self-reported child
age 12-13, an adolescent/adult form for ages >14 years, and a parent proxy format.
The respiratory domain of CFQ-R has also been utilized independently to evaluate
symptoms and perceptions of respiratory health and quality of life.
Reviewer’s Comment:
Neither the CFQ-R as a whole, nor the CFQ-R respiratory domain, has completed full
evaluation across all CF patient populations of all psychometric properties (reliability,
construct validity, sensitivity, and interpretability) in order to be considered “validated”
from a regulatory perspective.
The follow-up visit assessments for Part 1 and 2 consisted of physical exam, weight,
vital signs, pulse oximetry, and clinical labs. In addition to these, Part 1 added the
symptom questionnaire, and Part 2 added PK evaluations at follow-up. Patients who
prematurely discontinued for any reason completed a follow-up assessment 7 days after
last dose of study drug.

VX-770 (ivacaftor)
Population
Study 101 planned to enroll 20 patients in Part 1 and 18 for Part 2 (total N=38). There
were 41 patients randomized, and 39 received at least one dose of study drug, with 39
completing treatment as well.
For Part 1, eleven study sites were active (10 in the US and 1 in Canada), and 9 sites
enrolled at least one patient. For Part 2, 14 sites were active (12 in the US, 1 in
Canada, 1 in Germany) with 11 sites enrolling at least one patient. All patients were
Caucasian, half were male, and most (32 of 39) had F508 identified as their second
CFTR allele.
Summary of Notable Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
The pertinent inclusion criteria for Study 101 are as follows, and similar to subsequent
VX-770 studies:
• > 18 years of age
• Confirmed diagnosis of CF (as defined by the CF Foundation consensus
statement published in 1998), with G551D mutation in at least one CFTR-allele
• Part 1 patients could not have R117H or 2789+5G—>A as their second mutation;
Part 2 patients could have any second mutation
• FEV1 > 40% predicted, with no upper limit noted
Notable exclusion criteria include any acute or confounding chronic illness or medical
history, abnormal laboratory or ECG findings, recent use of intranasal medications (due
to NPD measurements), and pertinent concomitant medication exclusions.
Treatments
In Part 1, three dose levels of 25, 75, and 150mg administered every 12 hours for 14
days, were studied to find the therapeutic range, based upon concentrations that
increased gating activity of CFTR channel in vitro, and upon PK data from an earlier
study in healthy human volunteers. Part 2 doses of 150 and 250mg administered every
12 hours for 28 days were selected based on tolerability, PK/PD modeling from data
obtained in Part 1, changes in nasal potential difference and sweat chloride after
administration of VX-770 in Part 1, and from safety evaluations.
All medications for routine CF care were permitted (with the exception of cytochrome
P450 modifiers), and use of cycled inhaled antibiotic was timed to coincide with study
drug dosing from Day 1 through Day 28 in Part 2. No dose-modifications were allowed
in the study. Study drug dosing was 30 minutes after the start of a standard high-fat,
high-calorie CF meal or snack, which was the same as that for Studies 102, 103, 104,
and 105.

Patients were discontinued at any time if the patient, Investigator, or Applicant
determined it was not in the patient’s best interest to continue. In addition, need for use
of a prohibited medication or increase in safety labs or additional findings (i.e., rash)
would also disqualify a patient from further study.
Study Objectives
The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of VX-770, as described
by AE, SAE, clinical laboratory testing, vital signs, physical examination findings, and
ECG results. Secondary objectives included assessment of pharmacodynamic
parameters (change from baseline in nasal potential difference (NPD) and sweat
chloride), pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, and efficacy as determined by evaluations
of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and CFQ-R.
Conduct of the Trial
The study protocol was amended twice. Version 2 of the protocol added changes to
help better define the patient population and clarify laboratory and PK assessments.
Version 3 was the planned amendment which defined the doses used for Part 2 of the
study, and this amendment also clarified some safety evaluations, and streamlined
study assessments. There were four minor deviations from the statistical analysis plan
(SAP) reported, and a number of ad hoc analyses added. A key point to note is that,
after database lock and unblinding, the Applicant noted that the volumes of sweat
collected were not definitively measured, but rather estimated based on visual
comparison of a set of tubes with known volumes for comparison. This method was
within the standard operating procedure of the lab at the time, but resulted in collection
and use of sweat volumes exceeding the 100 microliter maximum capacity of the
proprietary Macroduct collection system used. Because the original SAP used the ion
concentration from the arm with the highest volume for analyses, data was re-analyzed
using an average from both arms instead, to correct for sweat volume impact on
outcomes. The original estimation method could potentially underestimate chloride
values, but would likely have affected both treatment and placebo patients. (Two
patients in Part 1 each had one sample with a total sweat volume over 100 microliters; 5
patients for Part 2 had such, including 1 patient with 1 sample volume >100 microliters,
2 patients with 2 sample volumes >100, 1 with 4 samples >100, and 1 with 7 samples
>100 microliters). Taking an average of the two values from each time point for all
patients mitigated any potential outlier values, and since this was done for all samples,
is reasonable. Overall, this likely did not influence final outcomes significantly, since
sample volumes >100 microliters were noted in only 16 samples out of a total of 508
sample collections for both parts of this study.

Reviewer’s Comments:
Study 101 was designed much like subsequent pivotal studies, with very similar
inclusion/exclusion criteria, withdrawal criteria, and schedules of assessments. One
difference is that, for patients in study 101, the spirometry was evaluated with
Hankinson reference values, whereas studies 102, 103, and 104 utilized Knudson
reference values. Because the reference values are valid for the population, and the
Applicant did not change reference values during the conduct of an individual study, this
does not affect interpretation of results. Another noted difference which does not affect
interpretation of data is that in this earlier study, the entire Cystic Fibrosis
Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) was evaluated as an endpoint, but subsequent studies
focused on the CFQ-R respiratory domain as an assessment of respiratory symptoms
(all studies collected the full CFQ-R data).

STUDY 102
Study Title:
VX08-770-102
A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group Study to
Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of VX-770 in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis and the
G551D Mutation
Study Dates: June 10, 2009, through January 11, 2011
Study Sites: 161 patients were enrolled at 65 sites in North America, Europe, and
Australia.

Description of Study 102
Study 102 was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of treatment with VX-770 compared to
placebo in patients with cystic fibrosis and at least one copy of the G551D mutation in
patients 12 years of age and older. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either
placebo or 150 mg VX-770 every 12 hours, for a total treatment period of 48 weeks,
with the primary efficacy endpoint measured at week 24. The medication was delivered
orally as one tablet by mouth every 12 hours, taken 30 minutes after the start of a highfat meal or snack. Patients received study drug from randomization until week 48 at the
final study visit, or alternately, they enrolled into study 105, the open-label extension,
where they received 150mg Q12 hours of 150mg VX-770 for an additional 40+ weeks.

Study Schedule
The study schedule for Study 102 is presented below; Study 103, discussed next in this
section of the review, was of similar design. All new patients began in a screening
period, from Day -35 to -15. During this time, it was confirmed that patients had
maintained a stable medication regimen for 4 weeks before screening through week 48,
which included continuation of a stable inhaled daily antibiotic, or continuation of a
cycled inhaled antibiotic, given that Day 1 and Visit weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48 all
occurred at the end of an “off” cycle, but no less than 14 days after the last dose of the
“on” cycle. The run-In period extended from Day-14 to Day -1, and documented patient
stability and adherence with the current medical regimen. The treatment period was
defined as Day -1 to week 24 visit, and the Applicant defined the second part of doubleblinded treatment during Week 24-48 as the treatment extension period. There was a
final follow-up visit for patients who did not roll over to Study 105.
Reviewer’s Comment:
The Applicant has labeled the first 24 weeks of double-blinded treatment as the
“Treatment Period,” and the second 24-week block of double-blinded treatment as the
“Treatment Extension Period.” This terminology is somewhat confusing, since
conventionally, “extension” studies are typically open-label assessments with unblinded
treatment regimens. Because some of this study’s key efficacy endpoints extend to
Week 48, and because Study 105 is noted as the open-label, long-term extension
safety study, this review will describe the entire double-blinded period from Day 1
through week 48 as the “treatment” period, and refer to Study 105 as the subsequent
“extension” study, in order to conform with conventional terminology, and to mitigate
reader confusion.

Screening assessments included comprehensive history, demographics, CF genotype,
review of prior and concomitant medications/ treatments, physical exam, vital signs,
pulse oximetry, ECG, spirometry, report of adverse events, and clinical laboratories.
Patients who met all the eligibility criteria and none of the exclusion criteria and for
whom there was documented informed consent/assent as applicable, continued into the
run-in period of study.
The run-in period was used to establish that patients on chronic cycled inhaled
antibiotics were at the proper place in their treatment cycle relative to randomization at
Day-1. Assessments performed at this visit included history, medication and treatment
review, pre-bronchodilator spirometry, completion of the CFQ-R form, and any
outcomes since the screening visit.
The double-blinded treatment period began at randomization on Day 1, and continued
through week 48. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either placebo or VX770. Patients for Study 102 were stratified for age (<18 vs. >18 year) and FEV1 (<70
vs. >70 % predicted). Patients continued their blinded study drug, with regularly
scheduled evaluations, through week 48. During the entire treatment period, patients
were monitored every 4 weeks, either by telephone contact or with a clinic visit [see
schedule of assessments table below].

Reviewer’s comment:
The inclusion/exclusion criteria as outlined are appropriate.
Treatments
Study treatments
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 150mg of VX-770 or placebo
orally every 12 hours, taken 30 minutes after the start of a high-fat meal, for 48 weeks.
Dose modification
Modification of the study drug dose was prohibited, but study drug could be interrupted
to allow for use of prohibited medications for up to 4 weeks during the second half of the
treatment period, from weeks 25 through 48 (during what the Applicant called the
“treatment extension period”).
Permitted Medications
Patients were expected to remain on their stable CF medication regimen from 4 weeks
before the screening period (Day -35 to Day -15) through the end of the study (week
48), with “stable CF regimen” defined as “current medication regimen that Patients have
been following for at least 4 weeks prior to screening.” Chronic inhaled antibiotics were
permitted to continue. Cycled inhaled antibiotics were also allowed, but Day 1 visit had
to be planned to occur at the end of an off-cycle (no less than 14 days after last dose).
Acute treatments for exacerbations were allowed per physician judgment.
Prohibited Medications
Inhaled hypertonic saline, while not FDA-approved as a treatment for CF, is commonly
used by CF patients as a mucolytic/expectorant, and was the only CF-specific treatment
excluded from this trial. Patients were allowed to wash out from inhaled saline therapy
in order to enroll in the trial. Any other investigational study drugs were not permissible
within 6 weeks prior to Day 1, and any drugs or dietary supplements that induced or

inhibited Cytochrome P450 enzymes were prohibited, including herbal St. John’s Wort,
and dietary or supplemental grapefruit.
Patient Discontinuation/Withdrawal Criteria
A patient could discontinue at any time, for any reason, throughout the trial. A patient
could be discontinued at any time from the study at the Investigator’s or Applicant’s
discretion, if continued participation was felt to be not in the patient’s best interest. In
addition, the Applicant had additional specific withdrawal criteria, listed below:
• If patient develops a condition that requires treatment with a prohibited
medication
• If they develop a life-threatening adverse reaction, or a serious adverse reaction
that places them at an immediate risk
• If a female patient becomes pregnant, or if a male patient’s partner becomes
pregnant (non-compliance with contraception requirements)
• If patient is non-compliant with study protocol, medication, or procedures
• If LFT’s increase 3x over highest baseline, or if absolute increase 5xULN
• If they experience a prolonged QTcF interval (>450 msec)
• If treatment becomes unblinded to any participant or provider in study
• If study closes early
• If a patient experienced a SAE which was not life-threatening nor was there
immediate risk, the patient may be removed (case-by-case basis)
Follow-up after Premature Discontinuation
Patients who discontinued would undergo an early termination visit. If the patient had
been on study treatment less than 4 weeks, there was a follow-up visit held 4 weeks
after the termination visit. If patients received more than 4 weeks of study drug, they
would undergo follow-up visits 4 weeks after the final study dose, as well as continued
follow-up visits every three months for the remainder of the planned 48-week treatment
and extension periods.
Replacement Plans
No patients were to be replaced if discontinued after randomization.
Efficacy Analyses
For Study 102, all efficacy parameters were based on the full analysis set, defined as all
randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug (i.e., VX-770 or
placebo). The primary efficacy parameter was the adjusted mean absolute change from
baseline in percent predicted FEV1 through week 24. Baseline is defined as the most
recent measurement prior to intake of the first dose of study drug. The primary efficacy
analysis utilized a mixed effects model for repeated measurements. With a mixed
effects model as the primary analysis model, no imputation of missing data was done.
However, sensitivity analyses assessing the impact of missing data on efficacy

evaluations were performed. [Source: Module 5.3.5.1.3, Clinical Study Report Body
102, Section 9.7.3.5]
Spirometry measurements were conducted in a uniform fashion across time and study
sites in accordance with procedural guidelines described in the protocols, and
performed according to the American Thoracic Society Guidelines, utilizing Knudson
reference standards. All spirometry was to be collected pre-bronchodilator, if possible,
defined as no SABA within 4 hours and no LABA within 12 hours. If patient forgot to
hold his SABA or LABA at the screening visit, then post- bronchodilator values were
recorded at screening, but all other visits collected pre-bronchodilator values. If Day 1
spirometry was measured pre-bronchodilator, but at another visit the patient forgot to
withhold SABA/LABA, then the post-bronchodilator values were collected for that visit
only. If patient used bronchodilator on Day 1, the Day 1 visit and all subsequent visits
collected post-bronchodilator values. [Source: Module 5.3.5.1.3, Clinical Study Report
Body 102, Section 9.7.3.5.1].
Key secondary endpoints were identified as absolute change from baseline in percent
predicted FEV1 through week 48, absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline to
week 24, absolute change in pooled (Child version for 12-13 year-olds, and adult
version for >14 years) CFQ-R respiratory domain score from baseline to week 24,
absolute change in weight from baseline to week 48, and time to first pulmonary
exacerbation through week 48.
Reviewer’s Comment:
While the full CFQ-R was completed by participants, the CFQ-R respiratory domain was
predefined as the key secondary outcome measurement to be evaluated. The
respiratory domain, as its name implies, focuses on respiratory health perception,
quality of life, and clinically-relevant respiratory symptoms, such as cough, wheezing,
and sputum production.
Additional endpoints included absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline to week
48, change in CFQ-R respiratory domain at week 48, absolute change in weight to week
24, and time to exacerbation through week 24. Additional spirometric and clinical
endpoints were also evaluated, including rate of decline in FEV1, change in oxygen
saturation, number of hospitalizations for exacerbations, number of outpatient sick
visits, and courses of outpatient antibiotic needed to treat sinopulmonary infections.
Study 102 included an endpoint of change in the EQ-5D score; this PRO tool is a
general measure of health-related quality of life, and is only validated in Patients over
age 12. Analyses of these endpoints were performed after 24 and 48 weeks of
treatment.
Event data, such as hospitalizations, exacerbations, courses of IV antibiotics, and
outpatient sick visits were analyzed in 3 ways: count (e.g., number of hospitalizations,
number of exacerbations, number of courses of IV antibiotics, and number of outpatient

STUDY 103
Studies 102 and 103 were of almost identical design, with both studies evaluating CF
patients with at least one copy of the G551D mutation, except that Study 103 was
performed in pediatric CF patients aged 6-11 years. In addition, Study 103 was divided
into two parts; Part A evaluated the PK in children to confirm the dose to be used in Part
B, which comprised the major efficacy and safety determination portion of the study.
Part A will be discussed in more detail in section 6.1.8 of this document, “Clinical
Information related to dosing.” The dose ultimately chosen for Part B was the same as
that for the adult (>12yo) population, at 150mg every 12 hours, taken 30 minutes after
the start of a high-fat meal. Both Studies 102 and 103 Part B had the same primary
efficacy endpoint of absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 through
week 24, with secondary efficacy and safety endpoints through weeks 24 and 48.

Study Sites: Part A included 8 US sites which enrolled 12 patients, and Part B included
24 sites in North America, Europe, and Australia which enrolled 52 patients.
Description of Study 103
PART A
Part A was designed to evaluate a single dose of VX-770 and was used to confirm the
dose for Part B. Part A was conducted in the same study population described below
as the subsequent safety and efficacy portion of study 103 (Part B). It included a
screening period (Days -28 to -2), an evaluation period (Days 1 to 2), and a follow-up
visit (Day 8 ± 2 days after the dose of VX-770). In Part A, enrollment was planned for a
minimum of 8 Patients (at least 3 of the 8 Patients must have been 6 to 8 years of age).
All Patients received a single, open-label dose of VX-770, 100 mg administered orally
30 minutes after the start of a high-fat, high calorie meal or snack on Day 1 of the
evaluation period. Blood PK samples were collected pre-dose and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and
24 hours post-dose to determine the plasma concentrations of VX-770 and metabolites
M1 and M6. The PK data from Part A were analyzed to determine the dose to carry
forward into Part B. All Patients completing Part A were offered the opportunity to
participate in Part B.
PART B
In 103 Part B, patients were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either placebo or 150 mg
VX-770 every 12 hours, for a total treatment period of 48 weeks, with the primary
efficacy endpoint measured at week 24. The medication was delivered orally as one
tablet every 12 hours, taken 30 minutes after the start of a high-fat meal or snack.
Patients received study drug from randomization until week 48 at the final study visit, or
alternately, they enrolled into study 105, the open-label extension, where they received
150mg Q12 hours of 150mg VX-770 for an additional 40+ weeks.
Reviewer’s Comment:
Since Study 103 Part B was the efficacy portion of this trial, it will be described in further
detail below. The subsequent sections refer to Part B of Study 103 unless otherwise
specified.
Study Schedule
The study Schedules for both Study 102 (previously described above) and 103 Part B
are roughly the same, with the caveat that any of the Patients who completed Part A of
103 could proceed directly to the run-in period of Part B without repeating a screening
period. All new patients began in a screening period, from Day -35 to -15. During this
time, it was confirmed that patients had maintained a stable medication regimen for 4
weeks before screening through week 48, which included continuation of a stable
inhaled daily antibiotic, or continuation of a cycled inhaled antibiotic, given that Day 1
and visit weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48 all occurred at the end of an “off” cycle, but no

less than 14 days after the last dose of the “on” cycle. The run-in period extended from
Day-14 to Day -1, and documented patient stability and adherence with the current
medical regimen. The double-blind treatment period of 103 Part B extended from Day
1 through week 48. There was a final follow-up visit for patients who did not roll over to
Study 105.
Reviewer’s Comment:
Please refer to the earlier reviewer’s comment with regard to terminology of the
treatment period.
The schematic for Study 103 part B is shown in the combined Figure 2: Schematic of
Study 102 and 103B Design, under the section above for Study 102 description.
Screening and run-in assessments were the same as for Study 102, outlined above.
The treatment period was the same as that for Study 102, except patients for Study 103
were stratified based on FEV1 percent predicted criteria of <70%, 70 to 90%, or >90 to
105% predicted; they were not further stratified by age. Patients were monitored every
4 weeks throughout the 48-week treatment period, either by telephone contact or clinic
visit. Please refer to Table 4: Study 102 and 103B Schedule of Assessments, under
Study 102 above.
All patients who completed through week 48 either enrolled into Study 105, the openlabel extension, or they completed a follow-up Visit, consisting of clinical laboratory
testing, serum pregnancy testing if applicable, abbreviated physical exam, ECG, and
adverse event assessments.
Patients who prematurely discontinued for any reason completed an early termination
visit, with the same parameters as for Study 102, described above.
Population
For Part A, enrollment was planned for a minimum of 8 patients; 12 patients were
enrolled, and 9 received at least 1 dose of VX-770.
For Part B, the planned enrollment was a minimum of 30 patients 6-11 years of age with
CF and at least one copy of the G551D-CFTR mutation, randomized 1:1 to VX-770 or
placebo. The actual enrollment included a total of 52 patients, 26 in each treatment
group.

Treatments
Study treatments
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 150mg of VX-770 or placebo
orally every 12 hours, taken 30 minutes after the start of a high-fat meal, for up to 48
weeks.
Dose modification, Permitted and Prohibited Medications
Modification of the 150mg study drug dose a determined in Part A was prohibited, but
study drug could be interrupted to allow for use of prohibited medications for up to 4
weeks during the second half of the treatment period, from Weeks 25 through 48
(during what the Applicant called the “Treatment Extension Period”). Permitted and
prohibited medications were the same as for Study 102, outlined above.
Patient Discontinuation/Withdrawal Criteria
A patient could discontinue at any time, for any reason, throughout the trial. A patient
could be discontinued at any time from the study at the Investigator’s or Applicant’s
discretion, if continued participation was felt to be not in the patient’s best interest.
Specific additional withdrawal criteria are the same as for Study 102, as are the planned
follow-up after premature discontinuation plans. As in Study 102, no Patients were
replaced if discontinued after randomization.
Efficacy Analyses
For study 103 part B, all efficacy parameters were based on the full analysis set,
defined as all randomized Patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug (i.e., VX38

770 or placebo). The primary efficacy parameter was the adjusted mean absolute
change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 through week 24. Baseline is defined
as the most recent measurement prior to intake of the first dose of study drug. [Source:
Module 5.3.5.1.3, Clinical Study Report Body 103, section 9.7.3.5] The primary
efficacy analysis utilized a mixed effects model for repeated measurements. With a
mixed effects model as the primary analysis model, no imputation of missing data was
done. However, sensitivity analyses assessing the impact of missing data on efficacy
evaluations were performed.
Spirometry measurements were conducted in a uniform fashion across time and study
sites in accordance with procedural guidelines described in the protocols, and
performed according to the American Thoracic Society Guidelines, utilizing Knudson
reference standards for both studies. All spirometry was to be collected prebronchodilator, if possible, defined as no SABA within 4 hours and no LABA within 12
hours. If patient forgot to hold his SABA or LABA at the Screening visit, then postbronchodilator values were recorded at screening, but all other visits collected prebronchodilator values. If Day 1 spirometry was measured pre-bronchodilator, but at
another visit the patient forgot to withhold SABA/LABA, then the post-bronchodilator
values were collected for that visit only. If patient used bronchodilator on Day 1, the
Day 1 visit and all subsequent visits collected post-bronchodilator values. [Source:
Module 5.3.5.1.3, Clinical Study Report Body 103, section 9.7.3.5.1]
Key secondary endpoints were identified as absolute change from baseline in percent
predicted FEV1 through week 48, absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline to
week 24, absolute change in CFQ-R respiratory domain score from baseline to week
24, and absolute change in weight from baseline at Week 24.
Additional spirometric and clinical endpoints were also evaluated after 24 and 48 weeks
of treatment. Event data, such as hospitalizations, exacerbations, courses of IV
antibiotics, and outpatient sick visits were analyzed in 3 ways: count (e.g., number of
hospitalizations, number of exacerbations, number of courses of IV antibiotics, and
number of outpatient visits); duration (e.g., days of hospitalization and exacerbations),
and time to first event (e.g., time to first exacerbation, time to first hospitalization, time to
the first use of IV antibiotics, and time to first outpatient visit). Statistical analyses were
modified if there were less than 5 Patients in the treatment group. [Source: Module
5.3.5.1.3, Clinical Study Report Body 103, Sections 9.7.3.5.2 and 9.7.3.5.3]
Protocol Amendments/Conduct
Study 103 had 6 protocol amendments, and 5 administrative letters before database
lock. These amendments were clarifying or administrative in nature, or increased the
safety monitoring of the program. These changes were not likely to have impacted the
analysis of data. A brief summary of significant changes is included in the table below.

STUDY 104
Study Title:
A Phase 2, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group Study to
Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of VX-770 in Patients Aged 12 Years and Older with
Cystic Fibrosis Who Are Homozygous for the F508del-CFTR Mutation
Study Dates:
September 21, 2009 through July 20, 2010 for Part A, through June 2011, for Part B
Study Sites:
This study was conducted at 34 sites in the United States.
Description of Study
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group multi-center
study (Part A) with an open-label extension (Part B) of orally-administered VX-770, in
patients with CF who were F508-homozygous. Part A was designed to evaluate the
safety and efficacy of 16 weeks’ treatment with orally-administered VX-770 to patients
greater than 12 years of age, and Part B was designed to evaluate the safety and
efficacy of long-term treatment with VX-770 in the same population.
Reviewer’s Comments:
Study 104 was performed for two reasons: to increase the safety database for VX-770
and to demonstrate whether the drug had any clinical activity in the F508 CFTRmutation, since F508 is the most common CFTR mutation, and because it creates a
non-gating defect. The Applicant had in vitro cell line data which suggested that cells
demonstrating F508 mutations responded to VX-770, but the physiology of abnormal
CFTR-proteins suggested that VX-770’s mechanism of action would not provide benefit
to Patients with a Class 2 CFTR-mutation such as F508, so this trial further tested that
theory. This study provides strong evidence that VX-770 does not offer any clinical
benefit to Patients with the most common CFTR-allele mutation, F508, in the absence
of a G551D mutation.

Study Schedule
The study Schedule for Study 104 Part A, the double-blind, placebo-controlled
treatment period, closely resembles that of both Study 102 and 103 Part B, with the
notable exception that 104 Part A lasted for 16 weeks only. The treatment period was
defined as Day -1 to week 16 visit. There was a final follow-up visit for Patients who did
not “respond,” and continue on into Part B, the open-label long-term extension.
Screening assessments were the same as for Studies 102 and 103, and included
comprehensive history, demographics, CF genotype, review of prior and concomitant
medications/ treatments, physical exam, vital signs, pulse oximetry, ECG, spirometry,
report of adverse events, and clinical laboratories. Patients who met all the eligibility
criteria and none of the exclusion criteria and for whom there was documented informed
consent/assent as applicable, continued into the run-in period of study.
The run-in period was used to establish that Patients on chronic cycled inhaled
antibiotics were at the proper place in their treatment cycle relative to randomization at
Day-1. Assessments performed at this visit included history, medication and treatment
review, pre-bronchodilator spirometry, completion of the CFQ-R form, and any
outcomes since the screening visit.
The treatment period included patient randomization at Day1, and continued through
week 16. Patients were randomized in a 1:4 fashion to either placebo or VX-770. The
schedule of assessments for Study 104 Part A is almost identical to those for studies
102/103B, except does not continue past Week 16.
At the end of week 16, Patients completed a follow-up visit 4 weeks + 7 days after last
dose of study drug. Alternately, those who met “responder” criteria could be reconsented, and continue into the open-label long-term safety extension (Part B).
Patients designated as “responders” from Part A could be continued into Part B,
originally planned to continue for 96 additional weeks (through week 112 of dosing).
The criteria for “responders” to participate in Part B of the trial include proper consent
and assent (if appropriate), completion of Part A, and must have either an increase from
(b) (4)
baseline in FEV1
predicted at one or more time points from Day 15 through week

16, or a decrease from baseline in sweat chloride concentration of
/L at both
Day 15 and week 8 visits. Of the 140 Patients enrolled in Part A, 38 met this definition
and enrolled in the open-label extension.
Patients who prematurely discontinued for any reason completed an early termination
visit as soon as the decision was made to terminate, consisting of the following:
collection of returned study drug, sweat chloride testing, serum pregnancy testing if
applicable, clinical laboratory assessments, physical exam with vital signs, weight,
height, and pulse oximetry, patient/parent reported outcome forms, ECG, pre-

bronchodilator spirometry, and assessment of adverse events. Patients who
prematurely discontinued in Part B had an early termination visit as soon as could be
scheduled, and were required to complete the extension period follow-up visit.
Reviewer’s Comment:
The Part B extension study was discontinued for futility in June 2011, after all Patients
had reached week 40, and results from Part A showed no benefit; full analysis up to
week 40 is available.
Population
Study 104 planned to enroll 120 Patients in Part A; no formal number was given for Part
B enrollment. 140 Patients actually enrolled in Part A and were randomized 1:4 to
placebo or VX-770 at 150mg orally Q12 hours for 16 weeks. Thirty-eight patients
subsequently met “responder” criteria and continued into the open-label extension
period (Part B).
Summary of Inclusion Criteria
The inclusion criteria for Study 104 are very similar to that for Studies 102 /103B, with
the following exceptions:
• population is > 12 years of age (the same as Study 102)
• Patients are homozygous for the F508- CFTR mutation
(b) (4)
• FEV1
predicted, with no upper limit noted
Definition of “Confirmed Diagnosis of CF”
This definition is the same for Study 104 as for 102/103B.
Summary of Exclusion Criteria
Exclusion criteria are the same for Study 104 as they are for 102/103B, including
disease-related, medical, abnormal laboratory values, and concomitant medication
exclusions.
Treatments
Study Treatments
Part A, the double-blinded treatment period, consisted of administration of placebo: VX770 in a 1:4 ratio, at a dose of 150mg orally every 12 hours for 16 weeks. The openlabel extension period (Part B) consisted of unblinded treatment with VX-770 at 150mg
Q12 hours, initially planned for a duration of 96 weeks, but it was discontinued early in
June 2011 for futility, after all Patients had completed treatment up to 40 weeks.
Permitted and prohibited medications were the same as for Studies 102/103B, and no
dose-modifications were allowed in the study. Dosing 30 minutes after the start of a

The first Informed Consent was signed on July 08, 2010; the Study is ongoing. The
Interim Analysis date was April 12, 2011, which was the date the last patient completed
the Week 12 Visit.
Study Sites:
This study is ongoing at 60 sites in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia.
Description of Study
Study 105 is the open-label extension study for patients enrolled in either study 102 or
103, which continues to follow patients for long-term safety and efficacy. Patients with
CF with G551D-CFTR on at least one allele and are at least 6 years of age are rolled
over into Study 105 after signing a separate informed consent and assent if applicable.
They receive 150mg of VX-770 orally every 12 hours, for an additional 96 weeks (or
until the drug is commercially available). Patients are allowed to use hypertonic saline
while enrolled in Study 105; this was a prohibited medication for Studies 102 and 103.
Patients are evaluated on Day 1, Day 15, and roughly every 12 weeks thereafter. The
primary objective was to collect additional safety information as evidenced by incidence
of AEs, clinical laboratory values, ECGs, vital signs, and physical exams. Other
endpoints included changes in spirometry, number of pulmonary exacerbations, rate of
change in weight, changes in patient-reported outcomes (PROs), number of
hospitalizations, outpatient sick visits, treatment with antibiotics for sinopulmonary
infections, and long-term evaluation of PK parameters of VX-770 and metabolites M1
and M6. Ongoing results from Study 105 will be discussed further in the Safety
discussion of this document, found in Section 7.

6 Review of Efficacy
Efficacy Summary
Support for the efficacy of the 150mg every 12 hour dose of VX-770 for the treatment of
cystic fibrosis in patients aged 6 and older with at least one copy of the G551D CFTR
mutation is derived from Studies 102 and 103 Part B. Both trials were randomized,
placebo-controlled, double-blinded 48-week period studies in patients with CF and at
least one copy in the G551D CFTR mutation. Study 102 evaluated patients 12 years
and older, whereas Study 103 included patients aged 6-11 years old.
Overall, these studies were of adequate design, and met the criteria for “adequate and
well-controlled studies,” as defined in 21 CFR 314.126. They evaluated an appropriate
patient population which was well-balanced at baseline between placebo and VX-770treated groups. The choices of patient population, control groups, and the primary
endpoint were relevant and clinically-meaningful to this patient population, and allowed

for a clear assessment of benefit. The analysis of the primary endpoint, absolute
change in percent predicted FEV1 through week 24, demonstrated a clinically and
statistically meaningful treatment effect, and the effect was substantiated by continued
durability through 48 weeks. The key secondary endpoints of change in weight, time-toexacerbation, and patient-reported respiratory symptoms such as cough, wheezing, etc.
(as measured by CFQ-R respiratory domain) all supported the primary efficacy
endpoint, as did the pharmacodynamic endpoint of change in sweat chloride
concentrations.
Both trials individually demonstrated a significant improvement in the primary endpoint,
and were supported by key secondary endpoints. The data from these trials were also
combined with a similar conclusion. VX-770 150mg dosed every 12 hours
demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in absolute change in percent
predicted FEV1compared to placebo at week 24 with a 10.6% improvement in adult and
adolescent patients in Study 102, and a 12.5% improvement in children 6 to 11 years
old in Study 103; these improvements were maintained at week 48 in both studies as
well .
The efficacy of VX-770 in the population of patients 12 years of age and older who were
homozygous for the F508-CFTR mutation was also studied in a single 16-week,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (study 104). At the end of the
placebo-controlled treatment period, there was no clinically- or statistically-significant
difference noted between the VX-770- and placebo-treated groups. This provides
strong evidence that VX-770 does not provide clinical benefit in this additional (more
common) patient population.

6.1 Indication
The Applicant’s proposed indication for VX-770 is use for the treatment of cystic fibrosis
in patients age 6 and older with a G551D-CFTR mutation.

6.1.1

Methods

This is a small program of two Phase 3 adequate and well-controlled clinical trials
(Studies 102 and 103B) which form the basis for efficacy determination in Patients with
cystic fibrosis and at least one G551D-CFTR mutation. The pre-specified design and
statistical analyses of these studies had been discussed with the Applicant in meetings
and communications, (as outlined in section 2.5
Summary of Presubmission
Regulatory Activity Related to Submission) and the Division informally agreed with the
Applicant’s proposal for the primary efficacy endpoint and statistical analysis thereof,
their planned approach to handle missing data, and the method to control the type I
error for the analyses of the primary and key secondary endpoints. Detailed analyses of
these results are described in the sections below.

The studies were of fairly robust design, with no significant flaws identified. The Agency
has no issue with the way in which the pre-specified analyses were conducted. Please
refer to section 5.3 of this document, “Discussion of Individual Studies,” for full details of
study descriptions.
Applicant’s Pre-specified analysis Methods
The Applicant pre-specified that they would utilize a mixed-effects model for repeated
measures (MMRM) for the primary efficacy analysis method, which assumes a stable
treatment effect over time. The MMRM was used to analyze the effects of VX-770 on
FEV1, sweat chloride concentration, and CFQ-R respiratory domain at 24 and 48
weeks. Because weight was expected to increase over the treatment period, a linear
mixed-model (LMM) was used for this data.
The Applicant pre-specified sequential testing for primary and key secondary endpoints,
to control of the Type I error rate. For study 102, the primary efficacy endpoint was
tested at a significance level of 0.05. After significance was determined for the primary
endpoint, changes from baseline through Week 24 in CFQ-R respiratory domain and in
sweat chloride were tested at a significance of 0.05. Finally, if positive results were
obtained, time-to-first-exacerbation through Week 48 and change from baseline in
weight at Week 48 were tested. For Study 103 Part B, the primary endpoint was
similarly tested at significance level of 0.05, followed by testing the changes from
baseline at Week 24 in weight and in sweat chloride levels at 0.05, and finally testing
change from baseline in CFQ-R respiratory domain score through Week 24. Multiple
sensitivity analyses were pre-specified, and performed to determine the robustness of
these analyses.
Both the FDA and the Applicant have primarily used the Full Analysis Set (FAS) data
for efficacy analysis, defined as all randomized Patients who received at least one dose
of study drug.

6.1.2

Demographics

A total of 213 patients were randomized in the two Phase 3 trials, with 161 patients from
study 102, and 52 from the efficacy portion of Study 103 (Part B). Within each study,
demographic characteristics were comparable between treatment groups, with respect
to age, sex, and race/ethnicity, as described in Table 8: Demographics of the Full
Analysis Set. Study 103 had more males receiving placebo and more females receiving
VX-770; this does not appear to have any clinical significance, but is rather a function of
small patient numbers. For both studies, the vast majority of patients were Caucasian,
which is not unexpected for a genetic disease most common in the Caucasian
population, with a genetic allele mutation (G551D) that is typically found in North

VX-770 (ivacaftor)
The second difference is that the number of patients utilizing inhaled cycled antibiotic
(TOBI® and colistin) is lower than expected. This number is more difficult to ascertain
because cycled antibiotic regimen is only used for patients who are found to be
chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and microbacterial status was not a
major parameter for this drug program. However, chronic oral azithromycin is used in
the same Pseudomonas-infected population, so numbers for these two treatment
modalities would be expected to be similar. Overall in the US, 30% of children aged 6
to 10, 50% of children aged 11-17, and 70 to 80% of adults 18 years and older are
chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 69% of these eligible patients
use TOBI1. Similar percentages exist for other countries14. In Study 102, 60% of
patients used azithromycin (similar to the overall percentage of CF patients expected to
use chronic anti-pseudomonal therapy), whereas only 40% of patients were treated with
inhaled TOBI and 8% with inhaled colistin. This is lower than what would be expected.
In Study 103, small overall numbers and a younger population less likely to be infected
with Pseudomonas could account for lower use of inhaled antibiotics; although 46% of
patients received oral azithromycin, 19% received inhaled TOBI and 18% received
colistin.
However, since prior medications were identified as those used within 30 days prior to
the screening period, if patients had delayed timing of a new cycle of inhaled antibiotic
treatment to meet enrollment criteria, their inhaled antibiotic use might not be
adequately captured in report forms.
Overall, the baseline demographics, patient characteristics, and prior medication use
demonstrate that the patient population for the VX-770 development program, while
small, demonstrated a fairly representative group of US and world-wide CF patients for
which the drug is intended.

6.1.3

Patient Disposition

There were a total of 213 patients evaluated for efficacy in two Phase 3 trials for VX770; 104 patients in placebo groups, and 109 patients in VX-770 groups. Disposition
information is provided in Table 11: Disposition of Phase 3 Patients (FAS). Overall,
91% of patients who enrolled in the Phase 3 program completed 48 weeks of study drug
treatment.

reviewer concurs. More significant protocol violations that led to patients being
excluded from the Per Protocol Set (PPS) include 10 patients for missing FEV1 or drug
compliance <80% and one with inclusion/exclusion violation (no G551D mutation) from
Study 102. Four patients from Study 103 were excluded from the PPS for violations
including missing FEV1 data, <80% drug compliance, prohibited use of hypertonic
saline, and one patient had an inclusion/exclusion violation (no G551D mutation).

Compliance and Exposure Rates
Treatment compliance and overall drug exposure data is shown below in Table 12:
Study Drug Exposure and Overall Compliance (FAS). For this table, the overall study
drug compliance is the ratio of the number of tablets taken, to the number of tablets
administered during each patient’s time on-study. The number of tablets consumed
was determined by pill counting; both protocols read that the study team will “review
returned study drug (empty/full blister cards)”. [Source: Module 5.3.5.1.17, section
16.2.2, Protocol VX088-770-102, section 13.3.4.2, and Module 5.3.5.1.4, Section
16.1.1, Protocol VX08-770-103, Section 13.6.4.2] Over 80% of patients in these trials
had >90% compliance with study medications, and no patients had less than 50%
compliance for the time they were on study treatment.

mortality7, 9. The majority of death in the CF population is due to pulmonary causes7,
so improvement in FEV1 is a useful and clinically-meaningful endpoint.
Change in FEV1 has been used as the primary basis for demonstration of clinical
benefit and subsequent regulatory approval for a wide variety of respiratory products.
Spirometry testing has standardized methods, and physicians and CF clinicians utilize
spirometric assessments to determine overall lung health chronically, as well as acute
worsening (pulmonary exacerbation), to guide overall patient management decisions,
such as when to give antibiotics, when to hospitalize, when to place a patient on a lung
transplant list. When performed according to accepted standard practices11, individual
patient data can be evaluated by the clinician for repeatability among values, and
reproducibility over time.

Choice of Control Population
The Applicant chose to conduct Phase 3 placebo-controlled studies, in addition to
regularly prescribed medications/ standard-of-care management. The Applicant’s
choice of a placebo control group is appropriate, since there are no other drugs with a
similar mechanism of action, to serve as an active comparator for VX-770.

Regulatory Adequacy of Trials
These Phase 3 clinical trials met the regulatory criteria for trial design of “Adequate &
Well-controlled,” as defined under 21 CFR 314.126, as listed below. These studies:
1. Had a clear statement of objectives, summary of methods proposed and
methods used
2. Used a study design of placebo concurrent-control, which allows for a
quantitative assessment of drug effect
3. Had methods of selection of patients that provided adequate assurance
that patients have the disease being studied
4. Utilized a method of assigning patients to treatment and control groups
which minimized bias and intended to assure comparability with respect to
pertinent variables (age, sex, severity of disease, use of therapies other
than test drug), and included additional stratification of key patient
characteristics
5. Contained adequate measures to minimize bias, including adequate
blinding and randomization procedures, prospective statistical analysis
plans, and clearly identified endpoints with hierarchical analysis
6. Identified methods of assessment of response that are well-defined and
reliable, and the protocol and study reports explain variables measured,
methods of observation, and criteria to assess responses

Change in CFQ-R respiratory domain
The change from baseline in the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire- Revised (CFQ-R)
respiratory domain score through week 24 was a key secondary endpoint for both
studies. As previously described in section 5.3, under Study 101, the CFQ-R is a
disease-specific health-related quality of life measure for cystic fibrosis used as a
Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) tool, consisting of generic and CF-specific scales
(grouped into 3 modules and 9 domains) that measure quality of life, health perception,
and symptoms over a 2-week recall period, and is available in age-appropriate formats.
The CFQ-R poses questions “during the past 2 weeks,” with regard to quality of life,
difficulty with activities, and symptoms. Specific topics include difficulty with physical
activities compared to peers, how patients felt emotionally, how much they experienced
treatment burden, their perception of health, trouble with school or work, and frequency
of respiratory symptoms, difficulty gaining weight, and GI complaints. The respiratory
domain focuses specifically on respiratory symptoms including cough, wheeze,
congestion, sputum production, difficulty breathing, and nighttime awakening due to
cough.
Reviewer’s Comment:
It is important to note that the CFQ-R respiratory domain has not been fully validated as
a PRO, as described in the FDA’s PRO Guidance. In studies to date, this tool has not
correlated directly with change in FEV1, so it measures a different parameter of overall

VX-770 (ivacaftor)
respiratory well-being not solely linked to pulmonary function. When taken into
consideration with other parameters of clinical improvement, the change in CFQ-R
respiratory domain lends additional support to the clinical benefit profile of VX-770, in
that patients find clinically-meaningful improvement in respiratory symptoms(cough,
wheezing, sputum production, etc.) that affect quality of life.
Study 102 used pooled versions of CFQ-R respiratory domain for adolescents/adults
and for 12-13 years of age, whereas Study 103 utilized the child version for 6 to 11
years of age, which was administered by the study coordinator in an interview format to
the patients. Study 102 demonstrated an improvement in respiratory symptoms as
measured by CFQ-R respiratory domain which met statistical significance, as noted in
Table 14: Summary of Key Secondary Endpoints, above. Study 103 data note a
difference of 6.1 points, but a p-value of 0.1092, which would not be considered
statistically significant.
Overall, the symptoms measured with the respiratory domain score of the CFQ-R are
clinically relevant to patients and providers, and VX-770 demonstrates an improvement
in respiratory symptomatology and well-being not solely linked to pulmonary function.
Improvements in these respiratory scores provide additional support for the benefit of
VX-770 in the CF population with at least one copy of the G551D allele.
Change in Time-to-Exacerbation
Time-to-first pulmonary exacerbation through Week 48 was a key secondary endpoint
for Study 102. It was not identified as a key secondary endpoint for Study 103 for two
reasons; the first being that younger children are generally healthier with milder lung
disease than older patients with CF, and less likely to have exacerbations, and the
second being that key efficacy endpoints were identified at week 24 for this study, and it
was thought the window too short to capture a meaningful change. This was the case,
as only 7 patients in Study 103 experienced an exacerbation by 24 weeks (3 placebo
and 4 VX-770). The definition for pulmonary exacerbation in both studies was the
same, and pre-established in the protocols. The definition is based on Fuch’s criteria15
of CF exacerbation from the clinical trials literature, with additional modification to state
that treatment for symptoms with antibiotic therapy could be given by parenteral, oral, or
inhaled routes, to accommodate for advances to standard-of-care.
For Study 102, the hazard ratio with a 95% confidence interval was 0.46 (P=0.0012),
which translates to a 55% reduction in risk of pulmonary exacerbation when treated with
VX-770 versus placebo, as demonstrated in the figure below.

Change in Sweat Chloride
The Applicant identified a change in sweat chloride value from baseline through week
24 as a key secondary endpoint for both studies, analyzed in the second tier of the prespecified statistical hierarchy. Results for both studies provided statistically significant
values for this pharmacodynamic endpoint; see Table 14: Summary of Key Secondary
Endpoints. Study 102 demonstrated a treatment difference of -48mmol/L (P< 0.0001),
and the treatment difference was -54mmol/L for Study 103 (P<0.0001). The effects
were sustained out to week 48 and retained statistical significance for both studies. The
decrease in sweat chloride concentration was noted in the treatment group at the first
measured time point, Day 15, and persisted through the treatment period. [Source:

For Study 103, additional endpoints evaluated through weeks 24 and 48 were the same
as for Study 102, except that pulmonary exacerbations were collected as a tertiary
endpoint (this was a key secondary outcome for study 102), and EQ-5D was not
evaluated, since this questionnaire is not applicable to children under 12 years of age.
In general, results were also supportive of the efficacy of VX-770 in the indicated
population.

6.1.6.2 Additional FDA Analyses
Correlation of Change in Weight to Change in FEV1
Because Studies 102 and 103 demonstrated a clinical improvement in weight as well as
an improvement in FEV1, the FDA wanted to explore if there was a correlation between
these two clinically important parameters. The post-hoc analysis performed by FDA
biostatistician Dr. Hoberman demonstrates that change in percent predicted FEV1 is
correlated with change in weight for each treatment group (r=0.32, p=0.004), but that
overall, change in percent predicted FEV1 is not a good predictor of change in weight.
However, investigation of any association between the maximum change in weight and
maximum change in percent predicted FEV1 was also performed. It demonstrates little
to no correlation in the placebo group, but there is evidence of correlation in the VX770-treated patients. The graph below displays change in weight on the x-axis and
change in FEV1 on the y-axis, with placebo patients denoted with a black plus sign (+),
and those who received VX-770 with a red plus sign (+). One can clearly see clustering
of the placebo group near the bottom left of the graph, indicating little change in FEV1
or weight, with the VX-770-treated patients clustered at the top right, indicating a larger
change in both FEV1 and weight at the 48-Week time point (verify this ). These findings
further strengthen support for VX-770’s efficacy in both pulmonary and non-pulmonary
outcomes.

Description of Patients with G551D-CFTR who Received VX-770 but
Achieved less than 5% Improvement in FEV1
While the overall efficacy data notes a statistically and clinically-significant improvement
by 10% percent predicted FEV1 at week 24, there was a group of patients who did not
demonstrate such an improvement. In examining data from Study 102, there were a
total of 25 patients who received VX-770, but did not achieve a change from baseline of
at least 5% in percent predicted FEV1 by week 48. Dr. Hoberman further evaluated the
data from this group of “non-responders” to see if any inferences could be made.
There were 18 from North America, 5 from Europe and 2 from Australia.
Examination of baselines and genotype did not reveal any pattern of covariates
which may account for ‘non-responders’. On the other hand, of those who
completed 48 weeks, there were 33 of 78 (43%) ivacaftor patients who achieved
a change of at least 5% at 15 days which persisted through 48 weeks. There was
1 of 69 in the placebo group. The respective numbers for persistence through 24
weeks were 43 (54%) in the ivacaftor group and 2 in the placebo group. [Dr.
Hoberman’s Review, page 16]

So there was a clear relation between treatment with VX-770, and improvement in
percent predicted FEV1. In addition, it is important to note that there is no significant
relationship between improvement in FEV1 and placebo treatment, further supporting

Standard Subpopulations
The Applicant analyzed the data for both studies 102 and 103 based on subpopulations, to evaluate for treatment effects. Data was divided by geographic region,
gender, baseline medications used, and baseline percent predicted FEV1. Study 102
treatment differences all favored VX-770; Study 103 was similar. In general, the
treatment comparison between VX-770 and placebo among the subgroups were similar
to the overall primary efficacy results.

Analysis of Clinical Information Relevant to Dosing Recommendations

The dose-finding portion of the VX-770 program is relatively small, but this is not
unexpected, given the orphan nature of the disease and the limited target population.
Initial in vitro data suggested that VX-770 needs to be present in adequate
concentration in plasma to maintain its effect, so the Applicant chose to use the
minimum observed concentration at steady state (Cmin,ss) as the target exposure for the
dosing throughout the dose interval. Dosing interval was chosen as 12 hours based on
the terminal half-life of VX-770. [Source: Module 2.7.2, Summary of Clinical
Pharmacology Studies, Section 1.2 and Module 2.5, Clinical Overview, Section 3.6]
Dose ranging for adults and adolescents consisted of study 101, which assessed doses
of 25, 75, 150, and 250 over a 14-28 day dosing period. Dose-ranging for children aged
6-11 years was evaluated in Part A of study 103 with collection of PK data from 12
patients after administration of a single 10mg-dose of VX-770, with subsequent PK
modeling to try to achieve comparable PK as that for adults in study 101. Please refer
to Section 5.3 of this document, in which both studies are described in more detail.
Results from Study 101 demonstrated that doses of 75 and 150mg every 12 hours for
14 days led to statistically-significant changes in FEV1, nasal potential difference, and
sweat chloride concentrations. Doses of 150 and 250mg twice daily for 28 days were
evaluated in Part 2 of that study, and led to statistically significant changes in FEV1 and
sweat chloride values (p< 0.05). See the table below for results.
The 150mg-dose was chosen to carry forward in development based on slight nominal
differences between the 75- and 150mg doses. The 250mg dose did not provide any
additional benefit over the 150mg dose.

Discussion of Persistence of Efficacy and/or Tolerance Effects

For studies 102 and 103 Part B, the primary efficacy time point was measured at week
24. The Applicant named the first 24 week block of double-blind, placebo-controlled
treatment as the “Treatment Period,” and the second 24-week block (to week 48) as the
“Treatment Extension Period.” Since both time periods are placebo-controlled and
double-blinded, this review describes the entire 48 week period as the Treatment
period. There was consistent efficacy demonstrated throughout this 48-week period,
with primary and supportive efficacy endpoints providing both clinically and statistically
meaningful outcomes.
Uncontrolled Extensions: Study 105 Data
Study 105 is the ongoing open-label extension for patients from Studies 102 and 103B.
An additional 12 weeks of open-label data suggest that efficacy as determined by FEV1
persists at least through 60 weeks of treatment. [Source: Module 2.7.3, Summary of
Clinical Efficacy, Section 5.2, and Module 5.3.5.2, VX08-770-105 Study Synopsisinterim report]

6.1.10 Additional Efficacy Analyses and Issues
Patients who are homozygous for the

F508 mutation in the CFTR gene

Study 104 was performed in patients with cystic fibrosis who are homozygous for the
F508- CFTR allele, as described previously in this review. Study 104 Part A was a
16-week, 4:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in 140
patients with CF age 12 years and older who were homozygous for the F508 mutation
(b) (4)
in the CFTR gene and who had FEV1
predicted (see 5.3
Discussion of
Individual Studies/Clinical Trials for full details of the study design). Patients were
randomized 4:1 to receive VX-770 150 mg (n=112) every twelve hours, or placebo
(n=28) in addition to their prescribed CF therapies. The mean age of patients enrolled
(b) (4)

was 23 years, and the mean baseline FEV1 was

As in Studies 102 and 103, patients who had Burkholderia cenocepacia, dolosa, or
Mycobacterium abcessus at screening isolated from sputum, and those with abnormal
liver function defined as liver function tests 3 times the upper limit of normal, were
excluded. Use of inhaled hypertonic saline was not permitted.
The primary endpoint was the same as that for studies 102 and 103; improvement in
lung function as determined by the mean absolute change from baseline through Week
16 in percent predicted FEV1. Treatment with VX-770 resulted in no improvement in

reviewer could imagine a large proportion of F508/ F508 patients, providers, and
families willing to use VX-770 in an off-label usage for individual patients to see if any
perceived benefit could be achieved. Strong evidence from the double-blind, placebocontrolled trial should be able to prevent much off-label usage, which would not
presumably provide benefit, but could lead to financial burden to these patients and
families.
Potential Flaws in Conduct or Analysis
Overall, the conduct of this clinical program was very good, with no significant flaws or
problems with conduct. The clinical site inspections found no irregularities in data
reporting, and studies were conducted in accordance with the current ICH-GCP
Guidelines, which are consistent with the ethical principles founded in the Declaration of
Helsinki. FDA Biostatisticians found no faults in the analysis of data for efficacy in the
VX-770 NDA package.
Strengths of Data
It is important to note that the FEV1 improvement measured in these clinical trials was
noted in addition to standard of care therapies and respiratory treatments currently
recommended for patients with cystic fibrosis, with the exception of use of hypertonic
saline. The improvement in patient weight was demonstrated in addition to standard of
care for pancreatic enzyme therapy, vitamin and mineral supplements, GI medications,
and additional dietary management including increased caloric intake and additional
supplementation with fat/ carbohydrates/ proteins. Therefore, the demonstration of
clinically-meaningful improvements in both lung function and weight is robust evidence
of efficacy in this subpopulation of patients with CF with at least one copy of the G551Dmutation in CFTR.

7 Review of Safety
Safety Summary
The safety information for VX-770 is derived primarily from studies 102, 103, and 104.
As the studies were of almost identical design and were conducted in patients with CF
with similar demographics, the data from these studies were pooled in order to assess
the safety of VX-770. In addition, since studies 102 and 103 were in the specific
indicated population of patients with CF, (those with the G551D mutation) data from
these studies were also analyzed separately. Safety assessments were adequate and
included adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs, ECGs, and clinical
laboratory testing. There were a total of 221 patients treated with VX-770 150 mg every
12 hours, and 132 patients treated with placebo. The mean treatment duration was

73
Reference ID: 3072893

Clinical Review
Witzmann, Kimberly A.
New Drug Application #203,188
VX-770 (ivacaftor)
similar between the treatment groups with mean 218 days for the VX-770 group and
265 days for those who received placebo.
Overall, the size of the safety database is acceptable for this sub-population of an
orphan disease. The one-year duration of placebo-controlled Studies 102 and 103,
supported by additional data from Study 104, is adequate to allow for a determination of
safety in the proposed population.
No deaths were reported during the placebo-controlled trials, and SAEs were within
what would be expected for a CF population, including CF exacerbations (reported as
CF lung), and other respiratory, GI, and metabolic concerns. There were a few SAEs
reported in the VX-770-treated group not reported in the placebo group, and these are
discussed individually. Review of additional safety data from healthy volunteers
demonstrated no concerns, and there were no new safety signals identified from
patients enrolled in the open-label extension studies.
Dropout and discontinuation data provided numbers overall, and in each subset, that
were small, and do not suggest any specific safety issue or signal. The overall
incidence of drug interruption was similar between treatment groups, with 8% of the
placebo patients and 7% of the VX-770 patients interrupting study drug for a variety of
events.
Two potential safety concerns identified in the nonclinical development program
included ECG changes (atrioventricular block and supraventricular premature
contractions) in dogs, and dose-related liver findings in both rodent species (rat and
mouse). These were AEs of interest in the Applicant’s clinical program.
The Applicant provided adequate monitoring of liver function, and appropriately altered
clinical monitoring based on an early identification of increased liver function parameters
in blinded safety review. There was one SAE of hepatic enzyme increased in a placebo
patient, and two in patients treated with VX-770. When considering liver-related
adverse events leading to study discontinuation, there were 2 placebo-treated and one
VX-770-treated patients, respectively. Interruption of study drug for elevated
transaminases was also similar between treatment groups. While there were a greater
number of interruptions for “hepatic enzymes increased” in the VX-770-treated patients,
these AEs were balanced by AEs of “AST, ALT, and transaminases increased” by
patients in the placebo group. Of the common liver-related adverse events in the
G551D safety set, the numbers suggest a small increase in overall transaminase
adverse events for the VX-770-treated group. Finally, when all transaminase events
were evaluated by prior history of elevated transaminases, the data was similar as well.
Therefore, the data with regard to liver safety is reassuring, and does not represent a
significant safety concern for the use of VX-770 in the indicated patient population.
Given the small increase in liver adverse events in the VX-770 group, and the CF
population in general having increased overall risk for elevated transaminases,
74

Clinical Review
Witzmann, Kimberly A.
New Drug Application #203,188
VX-770 (ivacaftor)
monitoring of liver function during initial treatment period with VX-770 is reasonable, and
will be labeled accordingly.
The second safety concern identified early in the VX-770 program on the basis of nonclinical findings was that of cardiac effects. Subjects were appropriately monitored
throughout the clinical program. The 24-hour ECG data from the pooled safety set
showed similar findings to the 12-lead ECGs, with clinically-significant events being
similar in both groups, but occurring at slightly decreased rates in the VX-770-treated
groups at baseline and throughout the treatment periods, to the last scheduled visit.
The Thorough QT study demonstrated no significant QTc prolongation effect of VX-770
at therapeutic or supra-therapeutic doses. So there is no apparent cardiac safety signal
for VX-770.
VX-770 is both an inhibitor and inducer of CYP3A, so there are a number of drug-drug
interactions possible with VX-770 that will require drug adjustment, or even
discontinuation. This is important to note, because a number of the drugs potentially
affected are commonly prescribed in patients with cystic fibrosis, either to treat CF or
the infections to which subjects are predisposed. These interactions have been
evaluated by clinical pharmacology, and will be addressed appropriately in the labeling
for VX-770.
The overall common adverse event profile identifies headache, rash, dizziness, and
upper respiratory tract infections at increased rates over placebo, none of which pose a
serious safety risk.
Overall, the safety risks of VX-770 are relatively small, as identified in the safety
database. The full discussion of safety, below, will describe this in more detail. The
safety data provided in this NDA is adequate for determination of safety of VX-770 in
the indicated population, and no additional clinical trials data is needed. However, due
to potential P-gp interactions of VX-770, the clinical pharmacology group has
determined that one additional post-marketing requirement study will be needed, to
assess this additional safety parameter. No REMS is required for VX-770, as all safety
information can be appropriately addressed in the labeling.

7.1 Methods

Studies/Clinical Trials Used to Evaluate Safety

The clinical development program for VX-770 consists of 23 studies; please refer to
Table 2: Late-Phase Studies Relevant to Clinical Regulatory Decision-Making, and
Table 3: Additional Studies in the VX-770 Clinical Development Program. A total of 700
persons received at least one dose of study drug of any dose and any duration. Of that

number, 376 were healthy volunteers or subjects with hepatic impairment, and 324 were
patients with cystic fibrosis.
Of the total 23 studies reported by the Applicant, one was a single-patient IND not
controlled by the Sponsor, five were the late-phase studies relevant to this regulatory
decision-making (the evaluable studies to be described in more detail), and three
studies were ongoing at the time of NDA submission (so did not contribute to the safety
numbers). The remaining 14 completed studies involved healthy volunteers or subjects
with hepatic impairment; eleven evaluated specific PK or food effect parameters,
including 6 drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies. Many of these involved cross-over
design. The three remaining studies included the QTc study (described in detail in 7.4.4
Electrocardiograms (ECGs)), the study in non-CF subjects with hepatic
impairment, and an open-label palatability of formulation study in 4 healthy volunteers.
Healthy volunteers in 6 of the completed 14 studies received only a single dose of VX770. Given the different objectives and short-term exposure to VX-770 in the majority of
these healthy subject studies, the data from non-CF patients will be considered
supportive, and discussed only where pertinent in the broader view of safety of VX-770.
The 5 later-phase studies in patients with cystic fibrosis are described in Table 2: LatePhase Studies Relevant to Clinical Regulatory Decision-Making. Study 101 was the
proof-of-concept trial in CF patients with the G551D mutation, which also contributed to
the dose-ranging safety. Part A of study 103 provided dose-finding in 6 to 11 year olds.
Part B of Study 104, and Study 105, are both open-label long-term safety studies, which
will be discussed briefly throughout the safety evaluation as uncontrolled safety data.
This leaves the evaluable Studies 102, 103 Part B, and 104 Part A to provide the basis
for the determination of safety in the CF population.
For the purposes of this review, the pooled safety set includes a total of 353 patients
with CF (G551D- or F508- CFTR-mutation) who received either placebo or VX-770 in
one of those 3 clinical trials, because a larger number of patients would facilitate the
detection of less common adverse reactions. Of that total pooled safety set, 221
patients with CF received VX-770 at a dose of 150mg every 12 hours during doubleblind, placebo-controlled clinical trials (Studies 102, 103 Part B, and 104 Part A), with
study periods ranging from 16 through 48 weeks, and 132 patients received placebo
treatment. 213 patients carried at least one G551D mutation in the CFTR gene (Studies
102 and 103), of which 109 received VX-770 and 104 received placebo treatment; these
patients comprise the G551D safety set. The other 112 CF patients that support the
safety database were enrolled in Study 104, and were homozygous for the F508CFTR allele. The initial focus of this safety discussion will be on analysis of the pooled
data from these 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, hereafter referred to as the
safety set, for the evaluation of deaths and major safety events. The discussion of
supportive safety (common adverse events) will be based upon the data collected in the
proposed patient population who carry at least one G551D mutation in the CFTR gene
(Studies 102 and 103B), as will be described in the product labeling.

The Applicant also includes safety data from uncontrolled open-label extension studies
(with a cut-off date of July 01, 2011), which includes additional data collected on 182
patients who participated in the VX-770 in the double-blinded studies and continued on
VX-770 in open-label extension and were rolled over to receive open-label VX-770 in
the extension studies. Due to design differences, data from the open-label extension
studies are not pooled, but listed separately as pertinent.

7.1.2

Categorization of Adverse Events

For the purposes of this development program, the Applicant defined adverse event
(AE) as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient during the study, which does not
require a causal relationship with study drug, and whether or not it is considered to be
study drug-related. It includes any newly occurring event, or previously-existing
condition that has increased in severity. Any abnormal laboratory assessment, ECG,
vital sign or physical exam finding that was judged by the investigator as clinically
meaningful were to be reported as adverse events.
Adverse events were classified using MedDRA Version 12.0 for all studies.
The Applicant also created special search categories for rash, abdominal pain, upper
respiratory tract infection, and elevated transaminases, and grouped these terms, even
if actual line item listing was from a different System Organ Class (SOC), if the medical
concept was similar. Discussion of these special search analyses are briefly discussed
under section 7.4.1 Common Adverse Events of this review.
This reviewer examined the individual narratives for serious adverse events (SAEs) and
discontinuations for treatment, and verbatim terms from narratives agreed with the
Applicant’s coding as preferred terms. There was no evidence of splitting or lumping in
the individual coding noted, and it was appropriate. In general, SAEs and
discontinuations appeared within the scope of what might be expected for patients with
cystic fibrosis, and were not significantly different across studies, as age and level of
lung disease would predict. Because this database is small, it is difficult to identify the
appropriate weight to ascribe to events that occurred only in the VX-770-treated group;
a single event might represent coincidence, or might be a suggestion of a potential
safety signal. Since there is no way to determine at this time, brief synopses of single
events that fall outside the expected norm for patients with cystic fibrosis are included
where appropriate.

Pooling of Data across Studies/Clinical Trials to Estimate and Compare
Incidence

Adverse event data was examined as pooled Phase 3 data in the G551D population,
versus total safety set data, versus individual study data from each of Studies 102,
103B, and 104A. In general, AE data was fairly similar, with adverse events that are
typically found in older patients and adults noted more often in Study 102, and more
complex disease complications noted in Study 102 as well. While Study 103 did have a
few AE which occurred with a higher incidence than in Study 102, the small overall
number of patients limits further comparison.

7.2 Adequacy of Safety Assessments
7.2.1

Overall Exposure at Appropriate Doses/Durations and Demographics of
Target Populations

Adequacy of Overall Clinical Experience
The Applicant’s safety submission provides information from double-blinded study
periods of 48 weeks, which is a reasonable length of time for a drug planned to be used
chronically, as outlined in Guidance ICH E1A. While this Guidance is not directly
applicable because those numbers it specifies are designed for more common
conditions, and CF is an orphan population, the Applicant has collected data in 109
patients with a G551D mutation treated with VX-770 150mg every 12 hours for 48+
weeks, which is close to the recommended 100+ patients for one year. In addition,
Study 104 adds safety data from another 112 patients homozygous for the F508
mutation for an additional 16 weeks. When the duration of treatment includes those
patients from Studies 102 and 104 who continued onto open-label extension studies
(Studies 104B and 105) through the safety cutoff date of July 01, 2011, there have been
63 patients who have received greater than 60 weeks’ exposure to VX-770, which
equals 74 person-years of drug exposure overall. This is not out of the range expected
for drugs developed for small orphan programs, and is reasonable. It is notable that
there is data available for patients with the G551D-mutation treated with VX-770 for
over a year. Given that these patients will likely remain on the drug throughout their
lifetime, except when requiring antibiotic or other drug treatment that is contraindicated
due to the drug-drug interaction profile, information regarding safety and durability of
treatment of at least one year is reassuring from a clinical safety perspective.
The studies in this clinical program were well-designed to assess safety of VX-770 in a
general population of CF patients, which covers a reasonable spectrum of disease.
The program was also designed to evaluate potential concerns identified in the non78

Demographics of the Safety Set
Overall, 92% of patients in the safety set completed the double-blind, placebo-controlled
treatment period, with 94% of those receiving VX-770, and 88% of those receiving
placebo completing. The most common reason for discontinuation was for adverse
events, which occurred in 1.8% of the VX-770 group, and 5.3% of the placebo group.
Overall, there were 30 patients who discontinued treatment (20 have been previously
described as the FAS in the efficacy section of this review, in 6.1.3 Patient Disposition);
the additional 10 patients from Study 104 include five patients who discontinued for an
adverse event (2 placebo and 3 VX-770), and the remaining 5 were VX-770-treated
patients: 2 who discontinued for non-compliance, and one each for requiring a
prohibited medication, loss to follow-up, and other reason (the patient wished to become
pregnant, and therefore no longer met eligibility criteria).
In total, 76% of patients were from North America, 16% from the European Union, and
8% from Australia. The proportion of males to females was similar, with 51% of patients
being female. Roughly 60% of patients in both VX-770 and placebo groups were age
18 or older, with a median age of 21 for the pooled safety set.

• Dizziness: 1.5% placebo, 7.1% VX-770 150mg, 2.9% VX-770 450mg
• Diarrhea: 1.5% placebo, 7.1% VX-770 150mg, 5.9% VX-770 450mg
The Applicant determined that the contact dermatitis was a result of the ECG lead
application.
Study 101 Part 2 assessed doses of 150mg or 250mg every 12 hours for 28 days in
patients with cystic fibrosis and at least one copy of the G551D mutation, aged
>18years. Four patients received placebo, 8 received 150mg, and 7 received 250mg
twice daily for the 28-day period. There were no deaths, no SAEs, and no AEs leading
to discontinuation or drug interruption in this study. The adverse event profile was
similar between the groups, and did not appear dose-related. There were no clinicallysignificant elevations from baseline in laboratory results (including AST, ALT, glucose,
or Total bilirubin) or ECG findings at any time point at the 250mg dose group.
Overall, there is a small amount of data that examines doses greater than the proposed
150mg every 12 hours, but what data is there does not appear to demonstrate any
significant safety concerns above the overall risk-benefit profile of VX-770.
Reviewer’s Comment:
This is somewhat reassuring, given that the risk of off-label use in children less than 6
years of age may occur when the 150mg dose becomes commercially available.
Noting no severe or significant adverse events in those that received higher than
proposed dosing is helpful to delineate that the therapeutic window for VX-770 is not
narrow.

7.2.4

Routine Clinical Testing

Routine clinical testing for this safety program included evaluations of hematology,
serum chemistries including liver transaminases, coagulation studies, and urinalyses.
Testing was adequate and appropriate. No important parameters were left out of
evaluations.

7.2.5

Metabolic, Clearance, and Interaction Workup

General information regarding the metabolism and clearance of VX-770 is found in
section 4.4 Clinical Pharmacology, of this review. Specific safety consequences of
drug-drug interactions are located in section 7.5.5
Drug-Drug Interactions.

7.2.6

Evaluation for Potential Adverse Events for Similar Drugs in Drug Class

This section is not applicable, as there are no other drugs with the same mechanism of
action as VX-770 with which to compare.

Anaphylactic Shock: A 12 year-old young man in Study 102 experienced a SAE
of CF exacerbation (CF lung) on Day 39 of treatment with VX-770. He continued
to worsen, and was hospitalized on Day 44. Study drug was placed on hold that
day, because of need for treatment with restricted medications. Closely following
the patient’s first infusion with the antibiotic levofloxacin, he experienced rash,
pruritis, difficulty breathing, and circulatory issues, and was transferred to the
ICU, where he received treatment with epinephrine, IV diphenhydramine, IV
dexamethasone, and IV bolus of normal saline. Study drug continued to be held,
and patient was discontinued from study treatment on Day 67, due to long-term
requirement for treatment with prohibited medications.
IgA Nephropathy: A 20 year-old woman in Study 102, with a past medical history
including episodes of hematuria and rhabdomyolysis, presented to an
Emergency Department on Day 72 of VX-770 treatment for an episode of
hematuria. She was admitted to the hospital for IV rehydration and treatment;
study drug continued. She presented with another SAE of hematuria on Day
100, and was again admitted to the hospital. She was seen by a nephrologist,
who gave a presumptive diagnosis of IgA nephropathy based on history,
physical, and laboratory findings (no renal biopsy was obtained). Patient
continued in the study, and completed VX-770 treatment.
Cervical Carcinoma: A 25 year-old woman enrolled in Study 102 was noted to
have an abnormal Pap smear on Day 71 of study treatment with VX-770. She
had a history of abnormal Pap smear 3 months prior to enrollment in Study 102,
which was followed by her medical team. On Day 204 of study treatment, she
underwent surgical procedure for the treatment of cervical cancer; the surgeon
felt the carcinoma was secondary to Human Papilloma Virus. The patient
remained on VX-770 treatment throughout this time, and completed study
treatment.
Depression/ Suicidal Ideation: An 18 year-old man enrolled in Study 104 with
prior history of depression experienced on Day 43 of VX-770 treatment a SAE
noted as “fatigue.” The patient was driving at 4am, and reportedly fell asleep
while driving, which led to a single-vehicle car accident. The patient was
transported to the Emergency Department, and discharged after a normal head
CT. Three days later (Day 46), the patient was hospitalized for one week, for
depression and suicidal ideation. He continued treatment with VX-770
throughout the entire treatment period of the study, even when hospitalized.
Myopathy: A 15 year-old male patient enrolled in Study 104 was noted to
complain of myopathy beginning on Day 2 of study treatment with VX-770. He
was hospitalized on Day 5 with severely abnormal laboratory values, and
treatment with VX-770 was discontinued on Day 5. The patient continued to
have intermittent episodes of elevated enzymes and myopathy throughout the
follow-up period, and subsequent genetic testing demonstrated homozygous
mutations of the AMPD1 gene, resulting in a diagnosis of myoadenylate
deaminase deficiency.

VX-770 (ivacaftor)
Of these cases described above, most had symptoms, lab findings, or histories noted
before enrollment in these studies that were supportive of an underlying disease
process (myopathy, IgA nephropathy, cervical carcinoma, depression/suicidal ideation).
Anaphylaxis due to VX-770 would be unusual to be caused at Day 44 of drug, and with
the study drug dose held, exceedingly rare. A much more likely mechanism is that the
reaction was caused by the temporally-related infusion of levofloxacin.
It is difficult to ascribe relatedness of VX-770 to the occurrence of spontaneous
abortion; pregnancy and wish to become pregnant were exclusion factors for these
trials, so the number of female patients who might have become pregnant during the
conduct of the study is small. The non-clinical reproductive data demonstrated no
teratogenicity, and no effects on peri- and post-natal development. Please also refer to
section 7.6.2 of this review, to discuss all pregnancy data.
SAEs in the Uncontrolled Safety Data
The interim 60-week data from 72 patients enrolled in open-label extensions (either
Study 104 Part B or Study 105) were evaluated for serious adverse events.
Specifically, the group of patients who received placebo in their earlier study, and
converted to VX-770 treatment, was examined.
For the 5 patients treated with placebo in Study 104 Part A, who transitioned to VX-770
for Part B, 2 SAEs were reported, both of CF lung (CF exacerbation). Of the 67 patients
who received placebo in Study 102 and transitioned to VX-770 in Study 105, there were
a total of 3 SAEs, including one report of hemoptysis, one of distal intestinal obstruction
syndrome (DIOS), and one report of acute suicidal depression; this case will be noted in
section 7.3.3 for discontinuations, below. Overall, there were no new safety signals
identified from patients enrolled in the open-label extension studies.

7.3.3

Dropouts and/or Discontinuations

The Applicant’s rules for discontinuation are discussed under each individual protocol in
section 5.3 of this document, and were the similar for the 3 placebo-controlled studies
from which the safety population is made.
Overall Profile of Discontinuations, Pooled Safety Set
Of the total 353 patients in the safety set, 92% completed the treatment period (to week
48 for Studies 102 and 103, and to week 16 for Study 104). Thirty patients discontinued
for any reason, the most common of which are for 11 patients discontinuing due to
Adverse Event, 5 for requiring a prohibited study medication, and 4 for non-compliance
with study requirements. These numbers overall, and in each subset, are small, and do
not suggest any specific safety issue or signal, nor do they have significant impact upon

c= Two placebo Patients experienced psychiatric AEs that led to discontinuation; Study 102 patient 02-60501 discontinued on Day 6 due to panic attacks, and Study 103 patient 03-203-02 discontinued on Day 169
due to violent outbursts classified as adjustment disorder, affective disorder, and anxiety
[Source: Module 5.3.5.3.28, ISS Table 2.1.3.9]

Since there are so few events in the VX-770-treated group, meaningful analyses of time
to dropout cannot be made; the few discontinuations are scattered throughout the 48week treatment period. The individual events that occurred in the VX-770-treated
patients include arthritis, myopathy, asthenia, fatigue, headache, and hepatic enzymes
increased. There were two patients in the placebo group who discontinued for
increased hepatic enzymes which were specifically coded as AST and ALT increased,
so the incidence of discontinuation for elevated transaminases was actually higher in
the placebo group.
Overall Discontinuations in the Uncontrolled Safety Data
There were few discontinuations in the uncontrolled open-label extension studies.
Looking specifically at those patients who initially received placebo treatment, then
transitioned to VX-770 treatment, there was only one report of adverse event leading to
discontinuation. This was a 24 year-old woman who did not have a formal history of
psychiatric issues, but who had been referred for counseling in the past, as documented
in her medical records. On Day 85 of treatment with VX-770, the patient had suicidal
ideation, and was admitted for psychiatric treatment. Study drug was discontinued at
that time.
The only other discontinuation for any reason in the uncontrolled extension studies by a
patient (initially receiving placebo in the double-blind portion of the study who then
transitioned to VX-770) is for a 36 year-old woman enrolled in Study 105 who had a
positive pregnancy test on Day 52 of VX-770. Please refer to section 7.6.2 of this
review for more details.
No Patients from Study 104B who received placebo in Part A discontinued early;
however, Study 104B in its entirety was discontinued for futility in June of 2011. (Study
104 enrolled CF patients homozygous for the F508- CFTR mutation, in which VX-770
was shown to be ineffective. Please refer to section 6.1.10 Additional Efficacy
Analyses and Issues, for more details.)

with 8% of the placebo patients and 7% of the VX-770 patients interrupting study drug
for a variety of events, described below in Table 23: Drug Interruptions Due to Adverse
Events, Pooled Safety Set. Overall, there was no difference in the types of adverse
events which led to drug interruption between the VX-770- and placebo-treated groups.
While there were a greater number of interruptions for “hepatic enzymes increased” in
the VX-770-treated patients, these AE were balanced by AE of “AST, ALT, and
transaminases increased” by patients in the placebo group. Patients either went on to
restart study drug, or were discontinued from the studies, as described in section 7.3.3

7.3.5

Submission Specific Primary Safety Concerns

Two potential safety signals identified in the nonclinical development included ECG
changes including atrioventricular block and supraventricular premature contractions in
dogs, and dose-related liver findings in both rodent species (rat and mouse). The safety
information for ECG data will be described under 7.4.4
Electrocardiograms
(ECGs), later in this review. The liver safety is examined in more detail, below.
Liver Safety
In the placebo-controlled safety and efficacy studies of VX-770, abnormal liver function
was an exclusion criterion at screening, defined as >3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) of 3
or more of the following values: AST, ALT, GGT, alkaline phosphatase, and total
bilirubin.
During the conduct of these studies, 3 patients were identified as having marked
elevations in transaminases levels, with AST and/or ALT levels > 8 x ULN. As a result,
the Applicant adjusted the frequency of monitoring liver parameters to every 2 weeks for
all study participants, in order to more closely monitor for potential liver toxicities.
During a pre-planned interim review of Studies 102 and 104 Part A, there were no
imbalances in severity or frequency of elevated transaminases. Subsequently,
monitoring of transaminases was amended to every 4 weeks. When later unblinded,
one patient with highly elevated transaminases was identified as receiving VX-770, and
the other 2 as receiving placebo treatment. In addition, a blinded review of data from all
3 studies did not note any concerning imbalances f data with regard to frequency or
severity of liver function abnormalities between the two treatment groups, so
transaminases monitoring was adjusted to every 12 weeks thereafter.
The actual number of patients reporting adverse events of hepatic enzymes, AST, or
ALT increased, are described in the table below for the G551D safety set. The
numbers suggest a small increase in overall transaminase adverse events for the VX770-treated group.

VX-770 (ivacaftor)
Common and Drug-related AE
Rash
Rash was a finding identified early in Phase 1/2 portions of the VX-770 clinical
development program as being potentially-related to drug. As a result, the Applicant
designed the large clinical study protocols to have a specific guidance and
recommendation plan for the identification and management of rash during the later
clinical trials.
Overall in the pooled safety set, there were no SAEs of rash, and no drug
discontinuations or interruptions due to an adverse event of rash. In the G551D safety
data, rash was a common AE noted to have a higher incidence in the VX-770-treated
population than in the placebo group, at a rate of 13% in the VX-770-treated group, vs.
7% of the placebo group.
Looking at individual study incidences, rash was reported as an adverse event in 3 (4%)
of placebo- and 8 (10%) of VX-770-treated patients in Study 102, in 3 (12%) of placebo
and 2 (8%) of VX-770-treated patients in Study 103B, and in 0 of placebo and 9 (8%) of
patients in Study 104.
In the Pooled Phase 1 safety data from this program, rash occurred in less than 3% of
patients in any treatment group, and in the uncontrolled data from the open-label
extension studies (104 Part B and 105) there were 3 patients who reported rash as an
adverse event, all of whom had received VX-770 in the double-blinded, placebocontrolled trials. So while associated with an increased incidence with use of VX-770,
rash has not been demonstrated to be at a severity which would lead to drug
discontinuation, interruption, or reporting of severe or serious adverse events. The risk
of rash while taking VX-770 will be incorporated into the labeling.
Dizziness
Dizziness was reported as an adverse event in 9% of VX-770-treated patients, versus in
1% of placebo-treated patients, in the G551D safety set. Dizziness was also reported in
the pooled Phase 1 findings of healthy volunteers, with 0 placebo-treated patients
reporting dizziness, versus 4% of those receiving only VX-770, and 5% of those who
received VX-770 alone or in combination with another drug. Dizziness will be included
in the labeling for VX-770.
Headache
Headache was reported in 24% of those treated with VX-770, versus 16% of those
treated with placebo, in the G551D safety set. Headache was also reported in the
pooled Phase 1 studies of healthy volunteers, reported with an incidence of 9% in
placebo-treated, versus 12% in VX-770-treated individuals. Headache will be included
in the labeling for VX-770.
Upper Respiratory Tract Infection

Reference ID: 3072893

Clinical Review
Witzmann, Kimberly A.
New Drug Application #203,188
VX-770 (ivacaftor)
Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) was reported in the G551D safety set with an
incidence of 22% in the VX-770-treated group, versus 14% in the placebo-treated
group. The mechanism of action by which VX-770 would cause increased URTIs is not
clear, and since the incidence of URTIs is relatively high in humans in general, it is
difficult to ascertain whether or not this represents a real treatment effect. The
Applicant evaluated this by combining 6 adverse event terms (oropharyngeal pain,
nasal congestion, nasopharyngitis, rhinitis, sinus congestion, and pharyngeal edema,
and upper respiratory tract infection) in post hoc analysis, to further quantitate the extent
of such events which might be captured under different preferred terms and system
organ class categories. However, this analysis does not seem to take into
consideration a number of equally-URI-related AE that were not incorporated into this
analysis, including “upper respiratory tract congestion,” “respiratory tract infection,”
“respiratory tract congestion,” and an additional thirty other terms arguably also related,
including 11 that occurred more frequently in the placebo group than in the VX-770treated patients. For example, “rhinitis” was chosen to pool under the URTI special
search, but “rhinorrhea,” which occurred more frequently in the placebo group, was not.
The Phase 1 data does not commonly report URTI; the complaint of nasopharyngitis
was noted to occur in 0 of the placebo-treated healthy volunteers, 0 of the VX-770-alone
treated volunteers, but 6% of those treated with VX-770 and a co-administered drug,
with an overall incidence of 3% in any VX-770-treated volunteers. Upper respiratory
Tract Infection will be included in the labeling for VX-770.
Subpopulations
The data was examined for any differences in potential safety signal with regard to sex,
gender, and age. Overall, there were no sub-populations with greater risk than the
overall risk profile of the entire pooled safety set.
Safety Data in Healthy Volunteers
The safety data collected in healthy volunteers and non-CF subjects with hepatic
impairment is very similar to the overall safety data from the VX-770 clinical program for
patients with cystic fibrosis, with similar percentages of subjects who discontinued due
to adverse events, and similar type of overall adverse events, including rash, headache,
dizziness, and nausea and vomiting. Two caveats to this statement are that CF-related
adverse events were not noted in healthy volunteers (as would be expected), and that a
large proportion of healthy volunteers described a bad taste for the early formulation of
(b) (4)
VX-770
the formulation was changed before proceeding
into later-phase studies.

7.4.2

Laboratory Findings

Routine clinical testing for this safety program included evaluations of hematology,
serum chemistries including liver transaminases (discussed above), coagulation
studies, and urinalyses. Overall, there were no significant differences in either median
or mean values for those receiving VX-770 versus placebo-treatment, throughout the
treatment periods.
Glucose Values
Study 101 had noted a total of 6 SAEs, 5 of which were observed in a known diabetic
patient, who had 5 reports of abnormal blood and urine glucose levels.
During the conduct of the Phase 2B/3 Studies, the informed consent document was
modified at the recommendation of the Data Monitoring Committee, to note a report of
SAE of hypoglycemia in a patient with CF-related diabetes. A 20-year-old woman
enrolled in Study 102 with history of CF-related diabetes was noted to have a blood
glucose measurement of 25mg/dL, and accompanying symptoms of confusion, feeling
hot, perspiration, weakness, and inability to feed herself. The patient was given oral
carbohydrates, and subsequently improved.
Because of the above events, the Applicant performed additional analyses regarding
glucose levels, including summary statistics and shift tables for the pooled safety set.
Overall, there were no significant differences in median, mean, maximum or minimum
glucose values for those receiving VX-770 versus placebo-treatment, throughout the
double-blinded treatment periods.

7.4.3

Vital Signs

No clinically significant mean or median changes in systolic or diastolic blood pressure,
heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature, or oxygen saturation were observed in
Patients during treatment with VX-770 versus placebo, as noted in the Safety set data.
Changes in body weight were assessed as measures of efficacy; see Section 6.1.5
Change in Weight, of this review for more details.

7.4.4

Electrocardiograms (ECGs)

Standard 12-lead ECG data for the pooled safety set noted that greater than 60% of
both treatment groups had abnormal but not clinically significant findings and 2% had
potentially-clinically significant findings at baseline. These incidences were similar for
both groups at the treatment visits where ECG was performed. Summary statistics of
heart rate, PR interval, RR interval, QT, QTcB, QTcF, QRS Axis, and QRS duration
were similar between treatment groups.

24-hour ECG monitoring was performed throughout the Phase 2/3 development
program, since the 12-month chronic toxicity in dogs demonstrated supraventricular
premature complex runs in 3 of 40 dogs at the higher dose levels, which resolved after
the one-month recovery period (suggesting it was treatment-related). The 24-hour ECG
data from the pooled safety set showed similar findings to the 12-lead ECGs, with
clinically-significant events being similar in both groups, but occurring at slightly
decreased rates in the VX-770-treated groups at baseline and throughout the treatment
periods, to the last scheduled visit. At the last scheduled visit, potentially –clinically
significant events were noted in 7.2% of placebo, versus 4.7% of VX-770-treated
patients. Study 008, the thorough QT study performed in healthy volunteers, did not
demonstrate any clinically-significant treatment effects; see section 7.4.5, below.

7.4.5

Special Safety Studies/Clinical Trials

A number of drug-drug interaction safety studies were conducted in the VX-770
program, including those for the use of VX-770 with ketoconazole, rifampin, midazolam,
rosiglitasone, fluconazole, desipramine, and oral contraceptives. These studies are
evaluated in detail in Dr. Lokesh Jain’s Clinical Pharmacology Review.
Study 008, the Thorough QTc study, has been discussed briefly with regard to the
safety profile of the 450mg-dose, in section 7.2.2
Explorations for Dose Response.
Below is a description of the QT safety results.
A thorough QT study was conducted for this program and reviewed by the FDA’s QT
study interdisciplinary review team. The study consisted of 2 parts, Part A in which 8
subjects were enrolled to evaluate the safety and tolerability of increasing doses of VX770 up to 450 mg every 12 hours (q12h), followed by Part B, to determine if therapeutic
or supra-therapeutic systemic exposure to multiple doses of VX-770 up to 450 mg q12h
prolongs the mean Fridericia-corrected QT (QTcF) interval by more than 5 milliseconds.
No significant toxicities were identified in Part A. The actual effect of multiple doses of
VX-770 150 mg and 450 mg on QTc was evaluated in Part B; a double-blind,
randomized, placebo- and active-controlled, single center, 4-period crossover study in
which 72 subjects received VX-770 150 mg q 12h, VX-770 450 mg q 12h, placebo, and
moxifloxacin 400 mg (the active comparator). The study was appropriately designed;
the supra-therapeutic dose of 450 mg q 12h produced mean Cmax approximately 4 times
higher than the mean Cmax for the therapeutic dose of 150 mg q 12h. No significant
QTc prolongation effect of VX-770 at the doses tested was detected. The largest upper
bounds of the 2-sided 90% CI for the mean differences between VX-770 150 mg and
placebo, and between VX-770 450 mg and placebo were below 10 ms (the threshold for
regulatory concern). Assay sensitivity was demonstrated, as the largest lower bound of
the 2-sided 90% CI for the
QTcF for the active comparator moxifloxacin was greater
than 5 ms (see table below).

Immunogenicity

VX-770 is a small molecule, and as such, immunogenicity would not be expected.
There was one report of anaphylaxis in the clinical safety program that bears note. The
patient presented with a serious adverse event of hospitalization for CF exacerbation,
and study drug was held due to need for treatment with a restricted medication. After
infusion with antibiotic, the patient developed anaphylaxis, as described in section 7.3.2
Nonfatal Serious Adverse Events, of this review. It is unlikely that this episode of
anaphylaxis was caused by VX-770, and a much more likely etiology of antibiotic
reaction can explain this event.

7.5 Other Safety Explorations
7.5.1

Dose Dependency for Adverse Events

There were no adverse events noted at higher incidences in patients who received
higher doses of VX-770 than the to-be-marketed dosage of 150mg every 12 hours.
There were no adverse events that occurred at a significantly higher rate in Study 103B
than in other studies, which might have suggested an increased exposure leading to
increased events.

7.5.2

Time Dependency for Adverse Events

No significant patterns or trends are apparent when evaluating either time-to-onset, or
duration of adverse event of patients who received VX-770 versus placebo study
treatment.

7.5.3

Drug-Demographic Interactions

Based on sub-group analysis of adverse events by sex, race, and age, no meaningful
differences were detected between patients in VX-770 and placebo groups. Analyses
of adverse events by geographic region were also similar.

7.5.4

Drug-Disease Interactions

Recommendations will be made in labeling for VX-770 to be administered with caution
or with dose adjustments in special populations; brief descriptions of such are listed
below. Please refer to full evaluations presented in detail in Dr. Lokesh Jain’s Clinical
Pharmacology Review for more information. Each of these will be addressed in the
labeling for VX-770.
Patients with Hepatic Impairment
Patients with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9)
had a similar VX-770 Cmax, but an approximately two-fold increase in VX-770 AUC0compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. Therefore, a reduced VX770 dose of 150 mg once daily is recommended for patients with moderate hepatic
impairment. The impact of mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) on
pharmacokinetics of VX-770 has not been studied, but the increase in VX-770 AUC0is expected to be less than two-fold. Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary for
patients with mild hepatic impairment. The impact of severe hepatic impairment (ChildPugh Class C) on pharmacokinetics of VX-770 has not been studied. VX-770 is not
recommended in these patients, as exposure is expected to be substantially higher and
the magnitude of increase is unknown.
Patients with Renal Impairment
VX-770 has not been studied in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal
impairment (creatinine clearance less than or equal to 60 mL/min) or in patients with
end stage renal disease. No dose adjustments are recommended for mild and
moderate renal impairment patients, because of negligible elimination of VX-770 and its
metabolites in urine (only 6.6% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine in a
human PK study); however, caution is recommended when administering VX-770 to
patients with severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease.

7.5.5

Drug-Drug Interactions

VX-770 has the potential to interact with several classes of drugs commonly used to
treat patients with CF. As a result, drug interaction studies were performed with VX-770
and other drugs likely to be co-administered, or those used as probes for
pharmacokinetic interaction studies. Significant drug-drug interactions were identified
with CYP3A inducers, CYP3A inhibitors, and CYP3A substrates.
Inhibitors of CYP3A
VX-770 is a sensitive CYP3A substrate. Co-administration with ketoconazole, a strong
CYP3A inhibitor, significantly increased VX-770 exposure [measured as area under the

VX-770 (ivacaftor)
curve (AUC)]) by 8.5-fold. Therefore, a reduction of the VX-770 dose to 150 mg twice
weekly (separated by at least 3 days) is recommended for co-administration with strong
CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole,
telithromycin, and clarithromycin.
Co-administration with fluconazole, a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A, increased VX-770
exposure by 3-fold. Therefore, a reduction of the VX-770 dose to 150 mg once daily is
recommended for patients taking concomitant moderated CYP3A inhibitors, such as
fluconazole and erythromycin.
Co-administration of VX-770 with grapefruit juice, which contains one or more
components that moderately inhibit CYP3A, may increase exposure of VX-770.
Therefore, food containing grapefruit or Seville oranges should be avoided during
treatment with VX-770.
Inducers of CYP3A
Co-administration with rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, significantly decreased VX770 exposure (AUC), by approximately 9-fold. Therefore, co-administration with strong
CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, carbamazeipne, phenytoin,
and St. John’s Wort is not recommended.
Potential for VX-770 to affect other drugs
CYP3A and/or P-gp Substrates
VX-770 and its M1 metabolite have the potential to inhibit CYP3A and P-gp.
Administration of VX-770 may increase systemic exposure of drugs which are
substrates of CYP3A and /or P-gp, which may increase or prolong their therapeutic
effect and adverse events. Therefore, caution is recommended when co-administering
VX-770 with CYP3A and/or P-gp substrates, such as digoxin, cyclosporine and
tacrolimus.
These studies are evaluated in detail in Dr. Lokesh Jain’s Clinical Pharmacology
Review; please refer there for further information. Each of these will be addressed in
the labeling for VX-770.

7.6 Additional Safety Evaluations
7.6.1

Human Carcinogenicity

No human carcinogenicity studies have been performed for VX-770. Two-year mouse
and 2-year rat carcinogenicity studies demonstrated that there were no test articlerelated tumor findings in either study. The clinical program for VX-770 noted one case
of cervical carcinoma in a 20-year old woman with history of abnormal Pap smear prior

to enrolling in the clinical trials. Please refer to section 7.3.2 Nonfatal Serious Adverse
Events, for more information.

7.6.2

Human Reproduction and Pregnancy Data

The use of VX-770 in pregnant or lactating women has not been studied in adequate
and well-controlled trials, so the effects of VX-770 on conception, pregnancy, and
lactation in humans are not known. Animal data demonstrated that VX-770 at 200
mg/kg/day decreased fertility indices in male and female rats, but that the drug was nonteratogenic in rats and rabbits. VX-770 had no effects on peri- and post-natal
development in rats. VX-770 was noted to be excreted into the milk of lactating rats.
All the clinical studies with VX-770 have noted pregnancy and lactation, as well as the
inability to comply with appropriate contraception practices, as exclusion criteria.
Nevertheless, there were three cases of pregnancy by patient or partner reported for
this development program. The first case was described in section 7.3.2 of this review,
under Serious Adverse Events leading to discontinuation, which describes a 32 year-old
woman treated with VX-770 noted to have a positive pregnancy test on screening.
Study drug was discontinued at that time, but subsequently, she had a spontaneous
abortion.
An additional case is noted of a 36 year-old woman who received placebo treatment in
Study 102, and rolled over to treatment with VX-770 in Study 105, who had a positive
pregnancy test on Day 52 of drug. She discontinued from the open-label extension the
same day. The Safety Update for this NDA submission notes that the patient delivered
(b) (6)
a female infant on
, and that mother and baby were well.
A healthy (non-CF) male patient in Study 009 was discontinued initially after reporting
his wife’s pregnancy during the study period, but further follow-up disclosed that the
study patient “was not involved in his partner’s becoming pregnant.”

7.6.3

Pediatrics and Assessment of Effects on Growth

Cystic Fibrosis is an orphan disease, and, as such, is not directly subject to pediatric
study requirements as defined under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA).
However, CF is a disease usually diagnosed early in life, and often identified on
prenatal testing or newborn screening, and the disease has a significant impact on its
pediatric population, given the morbidity, mortality, and shortened life expectancy for
children born with this disease. Therefore, the Applicant chose to evaluate patients with
CF who were 12 years of age and greater for Studies 102 and 104 (incorporating
adolescent patients), and children aged 6 to 11 years in Study 103, in the course of their
development program. The efficacy data noted in Section 6 of this review discusses the
12.5% improvement in percent predicted FEV1 at week 24 for Study 103, and section
105
Reference ID: 3072893

Clinical Review
Witzmann, Kimberly A.
New Drug Application #203,188
VX-770 (ivacaftor)
6.1.7 Subpopulations discusses Dr. Hoberman’s statistical analysis to look at efficacy
in the under 18 years pediatric group versus their adult counterparts in Study 102,
noting no differences in overall efficacy between groups.
Overall safety in the pediatric population is demonstrated with the results from Study
103, showing no new or increased rates of AE, SAE, or discontinuations due to AE
when compared to the entire CF patient population studied. FDA is already in
discussion with the Applicant in regard to their development program for studying VX770 in a younger pediatric population, as well.
Effect on pediatric growth is evaluated in an NDA review, since some drugs might have
a negative impact on children’s growth. For this program, the opposite was
demonstrated. Study 103 in children with CF aged 6 to 11 years, and Study 102 in
patients 12 years and older, noted significant efficacy data of increased weight, and
BMI-for-age-z-scores were significantly greater at weeks 24 and 48 for the VX-770treated patients than those treated with placebo. The BMI data supports that linear
growth increased for patients treated with VX-770, as well as weight. Therefore there is
no negative effect on growth or safety for children as young as 6 years of age treated
with VX-770.

7.6.4

Overdose, Drug Abuse Potential, Withdrawal and Rebound

No examination of abuse potential for VX-770 was performed during the non-clinical
and clinical phases of this development program. The clinical program does not
demonstrated adverse events that would be suggestive of mood alteration.
There have been no reports of overdose in the clinical program. Single doses as high
as 800mg in healthy volunteers, and repeat doses of 450mg x 9 doses and 250mg twice
daily for 28 days in CF patients, were well-tolerated; see Section 7.2.2
Explorations
for Dose Response for further information.
The potential for VX-770 to cause withdrawal and rebound were not formally studied in
this development program. However, there were no apparent changes in the safety or
tolerability profiles of VX-770 for Patients evaluated in the double-blind, placebocontrolled studies with regard to drug interruption, discontinuation, or treatment
completion, which suggests that the potential for such is unlikely.

7.7 Additional Submissions / Safety Issues
Per federal regulation 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b), a Safety Update including data from
clinical studies, animal studies, and other sources is required for a NDA submission.
The Applicant submitted their safety update for VX-770 on January 6, 2012, covering
the reporting period of July 2, 2011, through November 1, 2011.

VX-770 (ivacaftor)
This safety information provided covers the Applicant’s 4 ongoing studies, including the
open-label safety extensions 104B and 105, and studies 106 and 107 (exploratory
biomarker studies). It also includes study VX11-770-901, which is the Applicant’s
Expanded Access Program for patients who have at least one copy of G551D-allele in
CFTR and who have severe lung impairment (FEV1< 40% predicted), which began
enrolling subjects in the summer of 2011.
Deaths
There was one death reported for a patient enrolled in the Expanded Access Program
(Study 901). The patient was a 29-year-old man with end-stage CF lung disease, and a
history of rapid decline in lung function in the previous 3 years. At the time of screening,
his FEV1 was 38% predicted, he required chronic supplemental oxygen at 2-3L/min at
night, and had past medical history complicated by frequent CF exacerbations, chronic
respiratory insufficiency and hypoxia, pulmonary hypertension, and history of pulmonary
embolism, chronically treated with Coumadin. He began treatment with VX-770 on July
(b) (6)
23, 2011. On
, he began evaluation for lung transplantation. His
condition continued to deteriorate, and drug was held on September 19th, to allow for
treatment with voriconazole for a presumed Aspergillus infection. His condition
continued to deteriorate, and the patient and family made the decision to begin palliative
(b) (6)
and comfort care only; he died on
SAEs
The SAEs reported in the Safety Update are similar to those reported in the NDA
submission, and are consistent with the safety profile of VX-770 already described in
this review. There were no events that would suggest a new safety signal.

8 Postmarket Experience
No post-marketing data is available for VX-770 since it is not approved in any country at
this time.

9.2 Labeling Recommendations
Labeling discussions are ongoing with the Applicant and will not be complete by the
time this review is finalized. High level labeling issues from a clinical standpoint include:
• Indication: The proposed mutation-specific indication is appropriate. A “Limitation
of Use” statement will be added to note that VX-770 is not efficacious in CF
patients with the most common CF mutation (F508del).
• Warnings and Precautions: There are two precautions included in the labeling.
The first is with regard to monitoring of liver transaminases and drug interruption
for AST or ALT greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal, and the second is
that co-administration with CYP3A inducers is not recommended. Both of these
warnings are reasonable, given the safety findings delineated in this review, as
well as that of the Clinical Pharmacology team.
• Drug-Drug interactions: The drug-drug interaction profile for VX-770 is significant
with regard to CYP3A inhibitors, and will require a reduction in dosage with
concomitant use of drugs in this group. A number of drugs in this group are
prescribed for patients with cystic fibrosis (ie, to treat infections), so appropriate
labeling that identifies these drugs, and alternate dose recommendations, is
important with regard to safety.
• Special Populations: There will be a dose adjustment in pts with moderate
hepatic impairment, and a recommendation for careful monitoring of patients with
severe renal impairment.
• Clinical Studies: These sections of the label have been modified to clearly
differentiate the indicated G551D-allele CF patient population from those with the
most common CF mutation ( F508-allele), since Study 104 provides evidence
that VX-770 is not efficacious in that more common patient population. The
labeling now divides clinical information into mutation-specific sections, and fully
describes the results of Study 104.
• Patient Counseling Information: This section needs to be updated to reflect the
changes to the prescribing information, especially regarding DDI.

9.3 Advisory Committee Meeting
A pulmonary allergy drug advisory committee (PADAC) meeting was originally planned,
in order to discuss the safety and efficacy of VX-770. However, after our initial review,
the Division determined that the efficacy and safety were sufficiently robust, such that
delaying regulatory approval to discuss this at an AC was not necessary.
