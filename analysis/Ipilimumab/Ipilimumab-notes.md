Network properties:
* 1919 articles (1909-2013)
* 7487 authors
* 5666 institutions
* 26 grant agencies
* 199 clinical trials

##Ipilimumab-Pubmed-Search-PMIDs*.txt
For the peripheral network, we sampled results from the following search term:
* (("1900/1/1"[Date - Publication] : "2013/07/01"[Date - Publication])) AND melanoma  
 * Note: date range used to bound to latest pub in core network
 * ### hits spanning yyyy-yyyy 
  * took 200 pmids from every 7th page to collect 2000 articles, 5 times:
   * 1,8,15,22,29 | 2,9,16,23,30 | 3,10,17,24,31 | 4,11,18,25,32 | 5,12,19,26,33
   * to generate 5 PMID files to generate 5 independent peripheral networks

##Ipilimumab-peripheral*.pklz
Note: only level 1 if providing comparable number of pmids from pubmed search, i.e., comparable to core network article count.

##Analysis

Opened scored xgmml in Cytoscape
Selected authors into new subnetwork; selected institutes into new subnetwork
Exported default node tables for each subnetwork
Opened csv in excel
Pasted authors and scores from core-scored-sum author subnetworks into CP-Prop columns in analysis.xlsx template
Pasted authors and ct_scores from core-scored-sum author subnetworks into CT-Count columns
Pasted authors and score from core-scored-indegree author subnetworks into CP-Indegree columns
Pasted authors and score from peripheral-scored-indegree* author subnetworks into Denom-Indegree* columns
Template formulas calculation ranks and ratios
Note: averaged ratios across multiple samples of peripheral indegree to get a better RBR filter criteria, i.e., it covers more of the pubmed search result space, without compromizing the scope and size contraints of a given peripheral network. 


CPI subnetwork:
* ###  articles (yyy-yyyy)
* ## authors
* # institutes (# unique)
